This period saw notable variations in housing costs across districts, reflecting Tehran\u2019s diverse socio-economic landscape. Analyzing these changes helps reveal trends in real estate demand, construction activity, and broader economic factors influencing the market. This report examines detailed price data and the factors driving shifts in Tehran\u2019s housing market during these pivotal years.  \n\n## Summary of House Price Changes in Tehran (1393-1394)\n\n| Aspect                          | Year 1393 (2014-2015)               | Year 1394 (2015-2016)               | Change/Trend                         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Average price per sqm (citywide)| ~40,000 to 44,000 thousand IRR    | ~44,000 thousand IRR               | Moderate increase                  |\n| Price range in District 1       | 77,000 to 81,500 thousand IRR     | 79,000 to 81,000 thousand IRR     | Slight increase, stable high-end  |\n| Price range in affordable districts (e.g., District 20 & 18) | ~14,000 to 14,300 thousand IRR | ~17,800 to 18,000 thousand IRR    | Noticeable rise in lower-cost areas|\n| Construction cost per sqm       | Not specified                     | 11,174 thousand IRR (3% increase) | Rising construction costs          |\n| Private sector investment       | 205.4 trillion IRR                | 178.9 trillion IRR                | 12.9% decline                      |\n| Housing starts (number)         | Baseline                        | 40.1% decrease                   | Sharp slowdown in new construction |\n| Land price index (Tehran)       | Baseline                        | 1.4% increase                   | Modest land price growth           |\n\nDespite rising housing prices and construction costs, Tehran experienced a significant slowdown in construction activity and private investment in 1394. This divergence suggests economic pressures limiting new developments even as demand and prices edged upward. The persistent price gap between northern and southern districts underscores ongoing socio-economic disparities. Moving forward, monitoring these trends will be essential for policymakers and investors aiming to balance housing affordability with sustainable urban growth.\n\n## Overview of Tehran House Prices in 1393\n\nIn the Iranian year 1393 (2014-2015), Tehran's housing market exhibited notable regional price differences. According to Iran Open Data, the average price per square meter across Tehran ranged roughly between 14,000 and 81,500 thousand Iranian Rials depending on the district. The most expensive area, District 1, had prices from about 77,000 to 81,500 thousand IRR per square meter, while more affordable districts like District 20 saw prices near 14,000 to 14,300 thousand IRR. Central and northern districts generally commanded higher prices due to better amenities and location advantages.\n\nSeasonal fluctuations were present but prices remained relatively stable throughout the year. Overall, the average price per square meter in Tehran hovered around 40,000 to 44,000 thousand IRR in 1393, reflecting a robust real estate market with clear socio-economic stratification across districts.\n\nThis data highlights the significant disparity in housing costs within Tehran, influenced by geographic and economic factors, with northern districts near the Alborz mountains being the priciest.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Iran Open Data: Average purchase and sales prices of a square meter of land or old residential buildings in Tehran 1390-1394  \nhttps://iranopendata.org/en/dataset/average-purchase-sales-prices-square-meter-l-or-l-old-residential-buildgs-tehran-1390-1394/?view_id=cebd5f47-8ea0-4d94-9c42-2b09eb2b9ec5\n\n## Overview of Tehran House Prices in 1394\n\nIn the Iranian year 1394, the average price per square meter for residential properties in Tehran varied significantly across districts. Data from Iran Open Data shows that prices in upscale northern districts like District 1 ranged from approximately 79,000 to 81,000 thousand rials per square meter in autumn 1394. In contrast, more affordable southern districts such as District 18 had prices around 17,800 to 18,000 thousand rials per square meter during the same period. The overall city-wide average price was about 44,000 thousand rials per square meter.\n\nThis price distribution reflects the socio-economic diversity of Tehran, with northern areas commanding premium prices due to better infrastructure and environment, while southern districts remained more accessible. Compared to previous years, these figures indicate a steady increase in housing prices, consistent with broader economic trends in the construction sector during 1394.\n\nThe construction cost per square meter in Tehran was estimated at around 11,174 thousand rials, showing a 3% increase from the previous year. Despite a slowdown in construction starts and completions, housing prices maintained upward momentum, influenced by factors such as land price growth and inflation in construction services.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Iran Open Data: https://iranopendata.org/en/dataset/average-purchase-sales-prices-square-meter-l-or-l-old-residential-buildgs-tehran-1390-1394/?view_id=cebd5f47-8ea0-4d94-9c42-2b09eb2b9ec5  \n[2] Central Bank of Iran Economic Report 1394: https://cbi.ir/page/17383.aspx\n\n## Analysis of Price Changes Between 1393 and 1394\n\nBetween the Iranian years 1393 and 1394, Tehran experienced a complex trend in housing prices and construction activity. According to official data, the land price index in Tehran increased modestly by 1.4%, while the construction services price index rose by 12.9% in 1394 compared to 1393. However, private sector investment in new buildings in Tehran declined by 12.9%, from Rls. 205.4 trillion in 1393 to Rls. 178.9 trillion in 1394, indicating a slowdown in construction activity.\n\nThe average cost of construction per square meter in Tehran increased by 3.0% to Rls. 11,174 thousand. Meanwhile, the number of housing starts in Tehran fell sharply by 40.1%, and the total floor space of housing starts decreased by 19.2%. Completed buildings also declined by 26.7% in number and 18.4% in floor space across urban areas, including Tehran.\n\nRegionally, the land price index rose by 4.9% in other large cities and 15.7% in other urban areas, showing higher growth outside Tehran. The housing rental index in Tehran increased by 11.0%, reflecting rising rental costs.\n\nContributing factors to these changes include economic recession effects on private sector construction, a 13.4% decrease in construction permits, and a 6.6% increase in loans to the construction sector. Overall, while prices and costs rose moderately, construction investment and activity declined significantly in Tehran between 1393 and 1394.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Central Bank of Iran Economic Report 1394: https://cbi.ir/page/17383.aspx  \n[2] Tehran Land and Old Residential Building Prices Dataset: https://iranopendata.org/en/dataset/average-purchase-sales-prices-square-meter-l-or-l-old-residential-buildgs-tehran-1390-1394/?view_id=cebd5f47-8ea0-4d94-9c42-2b09eb2b9ec5\n\n# Tehran House Price Changes in 1393-1394\n\nThis report examines the shifts in Tehran's housing market between the Iranian years 1393 and 1394.

Housing prices in Tehran city also rose 78.9 percent in the eleventh Iranian calendar month (January 20 - February 18\n\nFULL CONTENT:\n# \n\n## Tehran housing market records an 85% annual growth\n\n![](https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2021/04/17/4/3743517.jpg \"Housing price\")\n\nTEHRAN \u2013 The housing market in Tehran was the second-highest returning market in Iran among the country\u2019s four major markets in the previous Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20) with 85 percent annual growth, ISNA reported.\n\nAs reported, the information obtained from Kilid website (which is a major platform for housing trades) indicated that the housing price index in Tehran grew by 85 percent in the previous year compared to its preceding year.\n\nThe highest monthly price increase of 12.5 percent occurred in the Iranian calendar month of Mordad (July 22-August 21, 2020), while the biggest monthly price decrease occurred in Azar (November 21-December 20, 2020) with a decline of 8.1 percent.\n\nIn the seventh month of the previous Iranian calendar year (September 22-October 21, 2020), the annual housing price index in Tehran grew by 121 percent, which was the highest increase compared to the same month of the preceding year.\n\nCoronavirus has been reported to be a major factor affecting the housing prices in Iran as the pandemic has stoked concerns about losing one\u2019s savings and more people entered the housing market.\n\n\u201cPeople are turning to the housing market in order to protect their savings in the face of rising inflation. No one sees housing as a short-term consumer commodity. Even real consumers view purchasing a home as a long-term investment,\u201d says Mehdi Soltan-Mohammadi, a housing expert.\n\nThe average price of each square meter of residential properties in Tehran increased from 263 million rials (about $6,262) in March 2020 to 530 million rials (about $12,620) in March 2021, which shows a 101 percent increase.\n\nHousing prices in Tehran city also rose 78.9 percent in the eleventh Iranian calendar month (January 20 \u2013 February 18), as compared to the same month of the past year, according to the latest report released by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI).\n\nFardin Yazdani, the planner of the Transport and Urban Development Ministry's Comprehensive Housing Initiative, however, believes that the housing prices in the Iranian market are not going to experience any sudden rise in the coming months and the market will stay stable.\n\n\u201cGiven the housing market situation and the trends in other parallel markets, there will be no significant change in the volume of housing transactions in the coming months,\u201d the portal of Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Trade (TCCIMA) quoted Yazdani as saying in early March.\n\nThe housing market expert further explained that price jumps occur when the rate of price increases in a market exceed the cost increase as well as the inflation rate, so apparently, no price jump is expected in the housing market in near future.\n\nExcessive price increases have left the market with a kind of imbalance between purchasing power and the owner expectations considering the existing prices; therefore, the market has entered a relative recession and this slump in trading is expected to continue, Yazdani said.\n\nHe further referred to the liquidity growth and its impact on the housing market and said: \"The liquidity growth will ultimately have its negative impacts on the asset market in the long run; as all the statistical data of the last two decades show, one of the most important and influential factors on the housing market has been the liquidity growth, which unfortunately continues to increase.\u201d\n\nAccording to Parvaneh Aslani, director-general of Housing Economy Office of the Transport and Urban Development Ministry, home prices have registered a 200 percent growth over the past five years.\n\nEF/MA\n\n## Tags\n\n## Leave a Comment\n\n##

The regime\u2019s 90 Eghtesadi website reported a 60% decline in transactions in this sector in 2023.\n\nIranian media reports indicate that the housing price in Tehran, based on the latest official data released on March 18 by the Statistical Center of Iran, has reached 833.12 million rials per square meter.\n\nReports suggest that the [average price of houses](https://iranfocus.com/economy/50927-housing-accounts-for-half-of-spending-by-tehran-households/) in Tehran has increased to 833.12 million rials after almost a year, precisely an increase of 168.72 million rials (approximately $275) per square meter.\n\nThis decline in transactions, according to some experts, indicates the continuation of the upward trend in prices in the market, which could lead to further declines in real estate transactions.\n\nAccording to reports, based on the Central Bank of Iran\u2019s data, the 11-month transactions (from April 2023 to March 2024) have been the lowest since 2016 and even before that.\n\nFurthermore, a comparison of the statistics of 2023 with the real estate transactions in 2017 shows a 75% reduction in this area.\n\nFrom the perspective of stakeholders in this field, this decline in transactions is likely to continue. Kianoush Goodarzi, the head of the Tehran Real Estate Consultants Union, stated that the real estate sector is influenced by various factors such as government fiscal policies, inflation, exchange rates, and more. He emphasized that what happens in the new year largely depends on the behaviors and policies of the government.\n\nGoodarzi told \u201cHamshahri\u201d newspaper that with the increase in the price of each dollar from 500,000 rials to 600,000 rials (the current price is around 61,350), sellers who were looking for buyers and offering discounts withdrew from selling and raised their offered prices by 20% to see what would happen in 2024.\n\nHossein Rostami, the head of the Mashhad Real Estate Consultants Union, also stated on March 27, \u201cThe government and the private sector must reduce the gap between supply and demand so that a change may occur in the housing market, and recession does not dominate the housing market this year.\u201d\n\nReviewing the developments in the Iranian real estate market indicates that the reduction in people\u2019s purchasing power is the most important factor in the inability of applicants to obtain housing.\n\nLast summer, the Research Center of the Majlis (Parliament) wrote in a report that the lower to middle-income groups, particularly those in deciles one to three, are \u201cabsolutely\u201d unable to provide the housing they need for residence.\n\nDuring the election campaign and after taking office as president, Ebrahim Raisi promised to build one million housing units per year. But more than two years into his government\u2019s term, he has yet to achieve any progress in this area.\n\n*   Tags\n*   [Iran's economy](https://iranfocus.com/tag/irans-economy/)\n*   [Life In Iran](https://iranfocus.com/tag/life-in-iran/)\n*   [Top Story](https://iranfocus.com/tag/top-story/)\n\nShare\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Firanfocus.com%2Feconomy%2F50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials%2F \"Facebook\")[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials&url=https%3A%2F%2Firanfocus.com%2Feconomy%2F50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials%2F&via=Iran_Focus \"Twitter\")[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&media=https://iranfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Iran_real-state.png&description=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"Pinterest\")[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&title=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"Linkedin\")[ReddIt](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&title=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"ReddIt\")\n\n[](https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/# \"More\")\n\nPrevious article\n\n[Iranian Woman Sara Tabrizi Suspiciously Dies After Arrest by Ministry of Intelligence](https://iranfocus.com/general/50974-iranian-woman-sara-tabrizi-suspiciously-dies-after-arrest-by-ministry-of-intelligence/)\n\nNext article\n\n[Questionable Motives behind Iran\u2019s Death Sentence for Police Officer who Killed Protester](https://iranfocus.com/human-rights/50982-questionable-motives-behind-irans-death-sentence-for-police-officer-who-killed-protester/)\n\n[![Image 4: Jubin Katiraie](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/05fa4251d192f5c98ca871f0e33d03a37fd3e1f99a943d371a70c3884816aeb9?s=96&d=mm&r=g)](https://iranfocus.com/author/jubin-katiraie/ \"Jubin Katiraie\")\n\n[Jubin Katiraie](https://iranfocus.com/author/jubin-katiraie/)\n\n#### Latest news\n\n[Iran Nuclear News](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/)June 7, 2025\n\n### [Warning Resolution by IAEA Board of Governors: Tehran Has Violated Its Safeguards Commitments](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/54452-warning-resolution-by-iaea-board-of-governors-tehran-has-violated-its-safeguards-commitments/ \"Warning Resolution by IAEA Board of Governors: Tehran Has Violated Its Safeguards Commitments\")\n\nIn a new and escalating development in the Iranian regime's nuclear case, four Western countries \u2014 the United States,...\n\n[Iran Nuclear News](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/)June 7, 2025\n\n### [Trump: Iran Will Not Enrich Uranium; Otherwise I Will Do Something I Don\u2019t Like](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/54449-trump-iran-will-not-enrich-uranium-otherwise-i-will-do-something-i-dont-like/ \"Trump: Iran Will Not Enrich Uranium; Otherwise I Will Do Something I Don\u2019t Like\")\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters about the Iranian regime's nuclear issue saying: \u201cThey won\u2019t be enriching.

The Statistics Center of Iran reported a staggering 43% increase in housing prices compared to the same period last year, whereas the Central Bank of Iran claimed a much more modest 14% inflation rate.\n\nAccording to a report published on the Central Bank\u2019s website on Sunday, September 1, the average price per square meter of residential property in Tehran was 87.5 million tomans in July 2024. This figure represented a 14.3% decrease compared to July 2023, and a 2% increase from June 2024. In contrast, the Statistics Center\u2019s data suggested a 43.1% year-over-year price hike for the same period.\n\nThe discrepancy between these reports highlights the ongoing volatility in Tehran\u2019s housing market. Over the past few years, housing inflation has experienced significant fluctuations. Central Bank data indicate that housing inflation surged from below 20% in April 2021 to over 100% in May of last year. Since then, it has trended downward, dipping below 10% in June 2024 before rising again to over 14% in July.\n\nThe Iranian regime\u2019s efforts to stabilize the housing market have fallen short of their ambitious goals. Upon taking office, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s administration promised to construct one million housing units annually to curb the crisis of soaring housing prices and rents. However, this promise has remained largely unfulfilled.\n\nWhen Raisi assumed office, the average price per square meter of a house in Tehran was under 32 million tomans. Despite this relatively low baseline, the housing market has seen significant price increases since then.\n\nOn April 25, Mohammad Reza Rezaei Kochi, Chairman of the Construction Commission of the regime\u2019s parliament, revealed that the \u2018National Housing Movement\u2019 plan had stalled, with progress reaching only 25%. He noted that only a \u201cvery small\u201d portion of government housing projects had been completed and delivered, and these were mainly tied to the \u2018National Housing Action\u2019 project initiated by the previous administration.\n\nThe Central Bank\u2019s data also show that the number of housing transactions in Tehran rose by 27% in July 2024 compared to the same month last year, totaling 3,559 units. However, this figure represents an 8% decrease in transactions from June 2024. For context, the Central Bank\u2019s archives indicate that nearly 15,000 housing transactions were recorded in Tehran in June 2017, before the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nIn addition to the fluctuations in housing prices, rents in Tehran have also sharply increased. According to the Central Bank, rent prices surged by 50% in July 2024 compared to the same month last year.\n\nThese conflicting reports and fluctuating statistics underscore the uncertainty and challenges facing Tehran\u2019s housing market as it continues to grapple with inflationary pressures and the unfulfilled promises of government intervention.\n\n#### [RELATED ARTICLES](#)[MORE FROM AUTHOR](#)\n\n![Shell Companies, Tax Evasion, and Structural Corruption in Iran\u2019s Economy](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC \"Shell Companies, Tax Evasion, and Structural Corruption in Iran\u2019s Economy\")\n\n### [Shell Companies, Tax Evasion, and Structural Corruption in Iran\u2019s Economy](https://irannewsupdate.com/news/economy/shell-companies-tax-evasion-and-structural-corruption-in-irans-economy/ \"Shell Companies, Tax Evasion, and Structural Corruption in Iran\u2019s Economy\")\n\n![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n\n### [Arrest of Iranian Cleric Kazem Seddiqi\u2019s Sons Sparks Public Outcry and Exposes Deepening Regime Crisis](https://irannewsupdate.com/news/infightings/arrest-of-iranian-cleric-kazem-seddiqis-sons-sparks-public-outcry-and-exposes-deepening-regime-crisis/ \"Arrest of Iranian Cleric Kazem Seddiqi\u2019s Sons Sparks Public Outcry and Exposes Deepening Regime Crisis\")\n\n![Iran Faces Record Trade Deficit Amid Sanctions and Economic Mismanagement](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC \"Iran Faces Record Trade Deficit Amid Sanctions and Economic Mismanagement\")\n\n### [Iran Faces Record Trade Deficit Amid Sanctions and Economic Mismanagement](https://irannewsupdate.com/news/economy/iran-faces-record-trade-deficit-amid-sanctions-and-economic-mismanagement/ \"Iran Faces Record Trade Deficit Amid Sanctions and Economic Mismanagement\")\n\n![Why the U.S. Cannot Afford to Ignore Iran Regime's Nuclear Ambitions](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC \"Why the U.S. Cannot Afford to Ignore Iran Regime\u2019s Nuclear Ambitions\")\n\n### [Why the U.S. Cannot Afford to Ignore Iran Regime\u2019s Nuclear Ambitions](https://irannewsupdate.com/news/nuclear/why-the-u-s-cannot-afford-to-ignore-iran-regimes-nuclear-ambitions/ \"Why the U.S. Cannot Afford to Ignore Iran Regime\u2019s Nuclear Ambitions\")\n\n![Rising Tensions and Fading Prospects: Iran, the U.S., and the Looming Threat of Conflict](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANoAAACWAQMAAACCSQSPAAAAA1BMVEWurq51dlI4AAAAAXRSTlMmkutdmwAAABpJREFUWMPtwQENAAAAwiD7p7bHBwwAAAAg7RD+AAGXD7BoAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC \"Rising Tensions and Fading Prospects: Iran, the U.S., and the Looming Threat of Conflict\")\n\n### [Rising Tensions and Fading Prospects: Iran, the U.S., and the Looming Threat of Conflict](https://irannewsupdate.com/news/nuclear/rising-tensions-and-fading-prospects-iran-the-u-s-and-the-looming-threat-of-conflict/ \"Rising Tensions and Fading Prospects: Iran, the U.S., and the Looming Threat of Conflict\")\n\n#### About Us\n\nAbout Us:\nPrecious analysis and exclusive details have become the Iran News Update a trusted counterweight to the state-run censorship in Iran...\n\n#### Categories\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSearch results: \n\n\n\n--- SOURCE 1: CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING - cbi.ir ---\nURL: https://cbi.ir/page/17383.aspx\n\nSUMMARY:\nIn 1394, of total Rls. 4,173.2 trillion loans and facilities extended by banks and non-bank credit institutions to various economic sectors, Rls. 431.1 trillion was extended to the construction and housing sector, indicating 6.6 percent increase compared with 1393. Private sector started the construction of 107.9 thousand buildings with a total floor space of 69.0 million square meters and an investment of Rls. 155.1 trillion (at current prices) in urban areas in 1394. In this year, 144.4 thousand buildings, with a total floor space of 88.2 million square meters, were completed by the private sector, down by 26.7 and 18.4 percent, respectively, compared with 1393.\n\nFULL CONTENT:\nECONOMIC REPORT AND BALANCE SHEET 1385 \n\n25 \n\nased on preliminary data on national accounts, the value-added growth of the construction sector fell by 17.0 percent to Rls. 349.0 trillion (at constant 1390 prices). This negative trend was mainly due to the recessionary conditions affecting the construction activities of the private sector. Gross fixed capital formation in this sector decreased by 10.7 percent in 1394 at constant 1390 prices. Furthermore, 13.4 percent decrease in the number of construction permits issued for urban areas and 13.5 percent decline in private sector investment in construction in urban areas are also indicative of the continuation of slowdown in this sector. The private sector started construction of 107.9 thousand new buildings, with a floor space of 69.0 million square meters in 1394. Moreover, 144.4 thousand buildings, with a total floor space of 88.2 million square meters, were completed by the private sector in this year. Total floor space of housing starts and completed buildings fell by 26.6 and 18.4 percent, respectively, compared with 1393. In 1394, land price index in urban areas and construction services price index registered 3.7 and 12.9 percent growth, respectively (base year: 1390). However, Producer Price Index for construction materials decreased by 6.2 percent compared with the year before, mainly attributable to the decline in the global price of metals used in the construction sector. \n\nPrivate Sector Investment in New Buildings in Urban Areas \n\nIn 1394, private sector investment in the buildings of urban areas fell by 13.5 percent (at current prices) to reach Rls. 701.5 trillion. Private sector investment in new buildings in Tehran declined by 12.9 percent to reach Rls. 178.9 trillion.

Ghayoumi](/author/z.%20ghayoumi) , [M. Mohammadzadeh\\*](/author/m.%20mohammadzadeh) , [K. Gholizadeh](/author/k.%20gholizadeh)\n\nLatent Gaussian models are flexible models that are applied in several statistical applications. When posterior marginals or full conditional distributions in hierarchical Bayesian inference from these models are not available in closed form, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are implemented. The component dependence of the latent field usually causes increase in computational time and divergence of algorithms. In this paper, an integrated nested Laplace approximation is used to solve these problems, in which the Laplace approximation and the numerical integration methods are combined in an efficient way so that hard simulations are replaced by fast computation and accurate approximation. Finally the relationship between house price data, floor size, age, number of rooms, building frame, type of proprietorship and facilities such as electricity, landline, water, gas, central heating and cooling system, kitchen goods, bath and toilet are modeled by using spatial latent Gaussian models. The fitted model can be used for predicting the house price in Tehran city.\n\n### [Latent Gaussian model](/keyword/101212/latent%20gaussian%20model) , [Gaussian Markov random field](/keyword/101212/gaussian%20markov%20random%20field) , [integrated nested Laplace approximation](/keyword/101212/integrated%20nested%20laplace%20approximation) , [Bayesian approach](/keyword/101212/bayesian%20approach)\n\n\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062e\u062a \u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0627\u06cc \u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u0634 \"[\u0634\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0637 \u062e\u062f\u0645\u0627\u062a](/help/membership#Policy)\" \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0648\u06cc \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0633\u062a.\n\n\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0639\u0636\u0648 \u0645\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u062f: \u0648\u0631\u0648\u062f\n\n\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0631\u0634\u062f\u0647 \u062b\u0628\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f.

One Advice is that I can suggest is to buy or rent your apartment or house in North West to West part of Tehran as the amount of pollution, lesser traffic, wider roads and also modern design of roads are into system to tackle the ever growing population of people in Tehran.\n\nHere we provide you a price list of area of Tehran, Tehran houses is prices according to age of the house **per square

\"ReddIt\")\n\n[](https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/# \"More\")\n\nAccording to the latest report by the Central Bank of Iran, the average housing price in Tehran has reached over 830 million rials (approximately $1,353). The regime\u2019s 90 Eghtesadi website reported a 60% decline in transactions in this sector in 2023.\n\nIranian media reports indicate that the housing price in Tehran, based on the latest official data released on March 18 by the Statistical Center of Iran, has reached 833.12 million rials per square meter.\n\nReports suggest that the [average price of houses](https://iranfocus.com/economy/50927-housing-accounts-for-half-of-spending-by-tehran-households/) in Tehran has increased to 833.12 million rials after almost a year, precisely an increase of 168.72 million rials (approximately $275) per square meter.\n\nThis decline in transactions, according to some experts, indicates the continuation of the upward trend in prices in the market, which could lead to further declines in real estate transactions.\n\nAccording to reports, based on the Central Bank of Iran\u2019s data, the 11-month transactions (from April 2023 to March 2024) have been the lowest since 2016 and even before that.\n\nFurthermore, a comparison of the statistics of 2023 with the real estate transactions in 2017 shows a 75% reduction in this area.\n\nFrom the perspective of stakeholders in this field, this decline in transactions is likely to continue. Kianoush Goodarzi, the head of the Tehran Real Estate Consultants Union, stated that the real estate sector is influenced by various factors such as government fiscal policies, inflation, exchange rates, and more. He emphasized that what happens in the new year largely depends on the behaviors and policies of the government.\n\nGoodarzi told \u201cHamshahri\u201d newspaper that with the increase in the price of each dollar from 500,000 rials to 600,000 rials (the current price is around 61,350), sellers who were looking for buyers and offering discounts withdrew from selling and raised their offered prices by 20% to see what would happen in 2024.\n\nHossein Rostami, the head of the Mashhad Real Estate Consultants Union, also stated on March 27, \u201cThe government and the private sector must reduce the gap between supply and demand so that a change may occur in the housing market, and recession does not dominate the housing market this year.\u201d\n\nReviewing the developments in the Iranian real estate market indicates that the reduction in people\u2019s purchasing power is the most important factor in the inability of applicants to obtain housing.\n\nLast summer, the Research Center of the Majlis (Parliament) wrote in a report that the lower to middle-income groups, particularly those in deciles one to three, are \u201cabsolutely\u201d unable to provide the housing they need for residence.\n\nDuring the election campaign and after taking office as president, Ebrahim Raisi promised to build one million housing units per year. But more than two years into his government\u2019s term, he has yet to achieve any progress in this area.\n\n*   Tags\n*   [Iran's economy](https://iranfocus.com/tag/irans-economy/)\n*   [Life In Iran](https://iranfocus.com/tag/life-in-iran/)\n*   [Top Story](https://iranfocus.com/tag/top-story/)\n\nShare\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Firanfocus.com%2Feconomy%2F50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials%2F \"Facebook\")[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials&url=https%3A%2F%2Firanfocus.com%2Feconomy%2F50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials%2F&via=Iran_Focus \"Twitter\")[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&media=https://iranfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Iran_real-state.png&description=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"Pinterest\")[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&title=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"Linkedin\")[ReddIt](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/&title=Average+Housing+Price+in+Tehran+at+830+million+Rials \"ReddIt\")\n\n[](https://iranfocus.com/economy/50978-average-housing-price-in-tehran-at-830-million-rials/# \"More\")\n\nPrevious article\n\n[Iranian Woman Sara Tabrizi Suspiciously Dies After Arrest by Ministry of Intelligence](https://iranfocus.com/general/50974-iranian-woman-sara-tabrizi-suspiciously-dies-after-arrest-by-ministry-of-intelligence/)\n\nNext article\n\n[Questionable Motives behind Iran\u2019s Death Sentence for Police Officer who Killed Protester](https://iranfocus.com/human-rights/50982-questionable-motives-behind-irans-death-sentence-for-police-officer-who-killed-protester/)\n\n[![Image 4: Jubin Katiraie](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/05fa4251d192f5c98ca871f0e33d03a37fd3e1f99a943d371a70c3884816aeb9?s=96&d=mm&r=g)](https://iranfocus.com/author/jubin-katiraie/ \"Jubin Katiraie\")\n\n[Jubin Katiraie](https://iranfocus.com/author/jubin-katiraie/)\n\n#### Latest news\n\n[Iran Nuclear News](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/)June 7, 2025\n\n### [Warning Resolution by IAEA Board of Governors: Tehran Has Violated Its Safeguards Commitments](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/54452-warning-resolution-by-iaea-board-of-governors-tehran-has-violated-its-safeguards-commitments/ \"Warning Resolution by IAEA Board of Governors: Tehran Has Violated Its Safeguards Commitments\")\n\nIn a new and escalating development in the Iranian regime's nuclear case, four Western countries \u2014 the United States,...\n\n[Iran Nuclear News](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/)June 7, 2025\n\n### [Trump: Iran Will Not Enrich Uranium; Otherwise I Will Do Something I Don\u2019t Like](https://iranfocus.com/nuclear/54449-trump-iran-will-not-enrich-uranium-otherwise-i-will-do-something-i-dont-like/ \"Trump: Iran Will Not Enrich Uranium; Otherwise I Will Do Something I Don\u2019t Like\")\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters about the Iranian regime's nuclear issue saying: \u201cThey won\u2019t be enriching.

Private sector started the construction of 107.9 thousand buildings with a total floor space of 69.0 million square meters and an investment of Rls. 155.1 trillion (at current prices) in urban areas in 1394. In this year, 144.4 thousand buildings, with a total floor space of 88.2 million square meters, were completed by the private sector, down by 26.7 and 18.4 percent, respectively, compared with 1393.\n\nFULL CONTENT:\nECONOMIC REPORT AND BALANCE SHEET 1385 \n\n25 \n\nased on preliminary data on national accounts, the value-added growth of the construction sector fell by 17.0 percent to Rls. 349.0 trillion (at constant 1390 prices). This negative trend was mainly due to the recessionary conditions affecting the construction activities of the private sector. Gross fixed capital formation in this sector decreased by 10.7 percent in 1394 at constant 1390 prices. Furthermore, 13.4 percent decrease in the number of construction permits issued for urban areas and 13.5 percent decline in private sector investment in construction in urban areas are also indicative of the continuation of slowdown in this sector. The private sector started construction of 107.9 thousand new buildings, with a floor space of 69.0 million square meters in 1394. Moreover, 144.4 thousand buildings, with a total floor space of 88.2 million square meters, were completed by the private sector in this year. Total floor space of housing starts and completed buildings fell by 26.6 and 18.4 percent, respectively, compared with 1393. In 1394, land price index in urban areas and construction services price index registered 3.7 and 12.9 percent growth, respectively (base year: 1390). However, Producer Price Index for construction materials decreased by 6.2 percent compared with the year before, mainly attributable to the decline in the global price of metals used in the construction sector. \n\nPrivate Sector Investment in New Buildings in Urban Areas \n\nIn 1394, private sector investment in the buildings of urban areas fell by 13.5 percent (at current prices) to reach Rls. 701.5 trillion. Private sector investment in new buildings in Tehran declined by 12.9 percent to reach Rls. 178.9 trillion. In other large cities and other urban areas, this variable decreased by 16.5 and 10.0 percent, respectively. \n\n# CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING \n\n# B\n\nTable 5.1.

thinking of returning to Iran, lost my wife,and have nothing to hold me here, I am looking for one bedroom in a quiet place, safe area in Thehran or a small villa in northern Iran, don't have kids to

The used statistical population in this study is the residential units\u2019 price in Tehran in 2021. For this purpose, the average per square meter of residential units in the city neighborhoods was entered in the geographical information system. Two techniques of ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression have been used to analyze housing prices and modeling. Then, the results of the ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted regression models were compared by using the housing price interpolation map predicted in each model and the accurate housing price interpolation map.\n\n### Findings\n\nBased on the results, the ordinary least squares regression model has poorly modeled housing prices in the study area. The results of the geographically weighted regression model show that the variables (access rate to sports fields, distance from gas station and water station) have a direct and significant effect. Still, the variable (distance from fault) has a non-significant impact on increasing housing prices at a city level. In addition, to identify the affecting variables of housing prices, the results confirm the desirability of the geographically weighted regression technique in terms of accuracy compared to the ordinary least squares regression technique in explaining housing prices. The results of this study indicate that the housing prices in Tehran are affected by the access level to urban services and facilities.\n\n### Originality/value\n\nIdentifying factors affecting housing prices helps create sustainable housing in Tehran. Building sustainable housing represents spending less energy during the construction process together with the utilization phase, which ultimately provides housing at an acceptable price for all income deciles. In housing construction, the more you consider the sustainable housing principles, the more sustainable housing you provide and you take a step toward sustainable development. Therefore, sustainable housing is an important planning factor for local authorities and developers. As a result, it is necessary to institutionalize an integrated vision based on the concepts of sustainable development in the field of housing in the Tehran metropolis.\n\n## Keywords\n\n## Citation\n\n[Rajaei, S.A.](/insight/search?q=Seyed Abbas Rajaei \"Seyed Abbas Rajaei\"), [Mottaghi, A.](/insight/search?q=Afshin Mottaghi \"Afshin Mottaghi\"), [Elhaei Sahar, H.](/insight/search?q=Hussein Elhaei Sahar \"Hussein Elhaei Sahar\") and [Bahadori, B.](/insight/search?q=Behnaz Bahadori \"Behnaz Bahadori\") (2024), \"Factors affecting the housing prices in the metropolis of Tehran\", *[International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis](/insight/publication/issn/1753-8270)*, Vol. 17 No. 6, pp. 1368-1391.

A noteworthy point in the study of housing price changes in the metropolis of Tehran is that the rate of price growth in different areas of Tehran has not been the same. Experience shows that price changes start in one district and then spread to other districts. Therefore, we should consider proximity and spatial dependence of housing prices in urban distrists.\n\n**2- THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK**\n\n In the analysis of housing price data, the spatial dependence between observations must be taken into consideration. Accordingly, many experimental studies have shown strong evidence of spatial dependence in the housing market between urban areas. Spatial dependence on housing prices is also referred to as the wave effect, implying that housing prices in a district cause changes in neighboring districts' prices. Behavioral economics is a theoretical basis that can express the phenomenon of spatial dependence between urban districts. Regarding the theories of behavioral economics, nearby urban areas have the same culture, history, environment, and policies. Other phenomena that express the spatial dependence in the housing market of urban districts include migration theory, capital transfer, arbitrage, and spatial patterns.\n\n**3- METHODOLOGY**\n\nA critical issue in studies using spatial econometric techniques is the choice of the type of spatial model. Depending on the type of spatial interaction, we will encounter a variety of spatial models. To select spatial models, we can first consider the general spatial model and with the relevant tests to ensure the existence of the type of spatial interaction factor. Then, the appropriate type of model can be selected. According to Elhorst (2014), using the spatial lag fixed-effect model, we have modeled the housing prices in 22 districts of Tehran city in this study. Some variables affecting housing prices are related to the demand side of the housing market, and some are related to the supply side. Here, the explanatory variables in the model are the annual population growth rate of the districts, and the annual growth rate of the real disposable per capita income, which shows the demand side influencing the housing price, as well as the number of building permits and the annual unemployment rate as the supply-side variables that affect housing prices. The dependent variable is the districts' average annual real growth rate of housing prices.\n\n**4- RESULTS & DISCUSSION**\n\n According to the spatial specification results, the dynamic SAR model has been selected as the appropriate model. The estimated coefficient of the spatial lag of the dependent variable with a time lag is 0.033, which is statistically significant and indicates a positive effect. It implies that the spatial lag of the dependent variable with a time lag has influenced the growth rate of housing prices in the 22 districts of Tehran. Among the explanatory variables affecting the growth rate of housing prices in the 22 districts of Tehran, it is observed that, except for the unemployment rate variable, the other variables have a significant effect on the growth rate of housing prices in Tehran districts. The analysis of the local Moran scatterplot demonstrates that the spatial correlation of the housing price growth rate in the northern districts of Tehran is different from the southern districts.\n\n**5- CONCLUSIONS****& SUGGESTIONS**\n\n Among the explanatory variables affecting the growth rate of housing prices in Tehran districts, except for the unemployment rate, other variables have statistically significant impacts. Two variables of the growth rate of income per capita and population growth rate have positive effects. However, the number of building permits has negatively influenced housing prices' growth rate. The statistically significant estimated coefficient of spatial lag of the dependent variable in the model implies the spatial effects of the housing price growth rate. All the necessary tests indicate that the null hypothesis, which indicates the lack of spatial autocorrelation, has been rejected, and a spatial correlation among the housing price growth rates of districts has been confirmed. The local Moran scatterplot illustrates that the Spatial correlation of housing price growth rate in the northern districts of Tehran is entirely different from the southern areas of Tehran. It is recommended that urban policymakers should not ignore the spatial relationship between housing prices in 22 districts of Tehran. Also, it is recommended to the policymakers, due to the different spatial correlation rate of the housing price growth rate in the southern areas of Tehran city compared to the northern districts of the city, for each of the northern and southern areas of Tehran, they should make different policies.\n\n**Keywords**\n\n*   [Housing prices](https://erd.um.ac.ir/?_action=article&kw=2709&_kw=Housing+prices&lang=en)\n*   [spatial dependence](https://erd.um.ac.ir/?_action=article&kw=59424&_kw=spatial+dependence&lang=en)\n*   [fixed effect model](https://erd.um.ac.ir/?_action=article&kw=73499&_kw=fixed+effect+model&lang=en)\n*   [dynamic spatial panel data model](https://erd.um.ac.ir/?_action=article&kw=82529&_kw=dynamic+spatial+panel+data+model&lang=en)\n\n###### [##### References](https://erd.um.ac.ir/article_41834.html?lang=en#collapseOne1)\n\n**References**\n\n\u200fAnselin, L.
