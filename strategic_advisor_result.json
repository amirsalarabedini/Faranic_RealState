  "market_overview": "Tehran's real estate market in early 2025 is characterized by cautious price appreciation of 5-10% amid high inflation (~30%), currency depreciation, and a significant 60% drop in transaction volumes, reflecting constrained liquidity and selective demand. Demand is concentrated in luxury northern districts (Elahiyeh, Zafaraniyeh, Niavaran) and affordable suburbs (Shahrak Gharb, Shahrak Al-Ghadir), while commercial real estate is rapidly expanding, supported by government housing initiatives and regulatory measures aimed at stabilizing prices and curbing speculation. The market outlook is neutral to cautiously positive, with risks from economic sanctions, currency volatility, and political instability requiring strategic mitigation. Investors benefit from focusing on renovation and redevelopment within Tehran\u2019s inner city, leveraging financial instruments, and engaging local expertise to navigate regulatory complexities.",
