### 3. Market Analysis & Principles

**Market Overview:**  
- Tehran’s residential market is experiencing moderate price growth (~16.8% YoY) despite macroeconomic headwinds such as over 35% inflation and a 35% depreciation of the Iranian rial.  
- Demand is concentrated on smaller apartments (<80 sqm), especially in prestigious northern neighborhoods (Elahiyeh, Zafaraniyeh, Niavaran), where prices can reach up to $2,000 per sqm.  
- Properties with modern amenities like gyms and proximity to metro stations command a premium of approximately 20%, enhancing both capital appreciation and rental yields (4.3% to 7.0%).  
- Market liquidity is constrained, with transaction volumes down 75%, and supply limited by rising construction costs and regulatory complexities.  
- Legal restrictions for foreign investors include prohibitions on direct land ownership, permit requirements, and cash-only transactions, necessitating expert local guidance.  

**Key Market Principles:**  
- Prioritize newer apartments in prime northern districts to capture demand and price premiums.  
- Target apartments under 80 sqm to align with market affordability and demand trends.  
- Modern amenities, especially gyms and metro access, significantly increase property value and rental appeal.
