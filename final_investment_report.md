## 2. Market Overview

The real estate market operates in cyclical phases influenced by a complex interplay of macroeconomic, demographic, and sector-specific factors. Currently, the market exhibits positive growth driven by:

- **Strong Economic Fundamentals:** Robust GDP growth, low unemployment, and rising incomes increase housing demand.
- **Demographic Trends:** Population growth and urbanization intensify demand, especially in metropolitan rental markets.
- **Inflation and Interest Rates:** Inflationary pressures raise construction costs, while fluctuating interest rates affect affordability and borrowing capacity.
- **Supply-Demand Imbalances:** Limited housing supply in key urban areas sustains upward price momentum.
- **Technological Advancements:** AI and GIS tools enhance market analysis, enabling early detection of phase shifts.

These factors collectively govern the transitions between market phases:

## 4. Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

- **Concentration Risk:** Overreliance on single markets or strategies increases vulnerability.

### Mitigation Strategies

- Continuous monitoring of macroeconomic indicators (GDP, employment, inflation).
