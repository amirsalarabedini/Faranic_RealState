Introduction\n---------------\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in various sectors, with healthcare being one of the most significant [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B1-bioengineering-11-00337)]. The integration of AI into hospitals and clinics represents a paradigm shift in how medical care is delivered and managed. This paper aims to explore the multifaceted role of AI in healthcare settings, focusing on its impact on clinical decision-making, hospital operations, medical diagnostics, patient care, and the ethical considerations it raises.\n\nThe concept of AI in healthcare is not new; it dates back to the early days of computer science when researchers first envisioned machines capable of mimicking human intelligence [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B2-bioengineering-11-00337)]. However, it was not until the advancement of machine learning algorithms [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B3-bioengineering-11-00337)] and the exponential increase in computational power and data availability [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B4-bioengineering-11-00337)] that AI applications in healthcare truly began to flourish. This evolution has been marked by significant milestones, from early expert systems [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B5-bioengineering-11-00337)] to advanced neural networks capable of outperforming human experts in specific tasks [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B6-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nToday, AI in healthcare encompasses a broad range of applications [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B7-bioengineering-11-00337)]. In clinical settings, it assists in diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes, and personalizing treatment plans [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B8-bioengineering-11-00337)]. In hospital management, AI optimizes operational efficiency, streamlines administrative tasks, and improves patient flow and scheduling [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B9-bioengineering-11-00337)]. In the field of medical diagnostics, AI enhances the accuracy and speed of image analysis in radiology and pathology [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B10-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Moreover, AI plays a crucial role in patient care through remote monitoring, telemedicine, and virtual assistance, fundamentally altering the patient\u2013doctor interaction paradigm [[11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B11-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nThis paper explores artificial intelligence\u2019s evolving role in healthcare, focusing on its application in hospitals and clinics. In consideration of the extensive scope of this study, we employed a meticulous approach in selecting references, focusing primarily on works published within reputable journals over the past five years. Our search was conducted using both Google Scholar and PubMed, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the pertinent literature. [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#bioengineering-11-00337-f001) provides a comprehensive overview of the key topics addressed in this paper. We start with AI in clinical decision-making, highlighting its use in diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized medicine through specific disease case studies. The discussion then moves to AI\u2019s role in improving hospital operations and management, including logistics, administrative tasks, and scheduling. Further, we examine AI in medical imaging and diagnostics, where it enhances accuracy and efficiency in radiology and pathology. This paper also covers AI\u2019s impact on patient care and monitoring, with a look at AI-powered wearables and virtual nursing assistants, and the expansion of telemedicine.

AI in Clinical Decision-Making\n---------------------------------\n\nThis section explores how AI, with its advanced learning and processing capabilities, is reshaping the domain of medical diagnostics and treatment. By harnessing the power of AI, healthcare professionals are now equipped with tools that provide deeper insights into patient data. This leads to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans. We will explore three critical aspects: AI algorithms for diagnosis and prognosis, case studies of AI in detecting diseases like cancer and diabetes, and AI\u2019s role in the growing field of personalized medicine.\n\n### 2.1. AI Algorithms for Diagnosis and Prognosis\n\nAI algorithms are becoming important contributors in diagnosing and predicting diseases and offer new insights to healthcare. These algorithms analyze vast amounts of medical data to identify patterns and correlations that might elude human analysis. For instance, in oncology, AI algorithms can sift through radiographic images, genetic information, and patient histories to detect cancer at early stages [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B12-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Similarly, in the field of cardiology, AI models are employed to predict heart attacks and strokes by analyzing ECG patterns and other vital signs [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B13-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nOne of the key strengths of AI in diagnosis is its ability to continually learn and improve. As these algorithms are exposed to more data, their diagnostic precision and predictive accuracy are enhanced. This is crucial in managing complex and chronic diseases where early detection and timely intervention can be life-saving [[14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B14-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nMoreover, AI\u2019s role in prognosis is equally transformative [[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B15-bioengineering-11-00337),[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B16-bioengineering-11-00337)]. By analyzing patterns in disease progression, AI can forecast potential complications, enabling healthcare professionals to devise preemptive strategies. This is particularly important in chronic diseases like diabetes, where AI can predict potential risks, such as kidney failure or vision loss, by analyzing blood sugar levels, lifestyle factors, and treatment responses over time [[17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B17-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nAI algorithms can be broadly categorized into machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, each with unique strengths and applications:\n\n1.   Machine learning (ML): ML algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the task [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B18-bioengineering-11-00337)]. In healthcare, supervised learning algorithms have been instrumental in developing predictive models for patient outcomes based on historical data [[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B19-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is used to identify patterns or clusters within data, useful in discovering novel disease subtypes [[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B20-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Reinforcement learning, where algorithms learn to make sequences of decisions by trial and error, has potential in personalized treatment optimization [[21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B21-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\n2.   Deep learning (DL): A subset of ML, deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence \u201cdeep\u201d) to analyze complex data structures. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective in processing imaging data, making them invaluable for diagnosing diseases from medical images like X-rays or MRIs [[22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B22-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Some other advanced CNN architectures include Residual Network (ResNet), Inception, Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), each with its own strengths and applications in image analysis, classification, and graph data processing [[23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B23-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), known for their ability to handle sequential data, are used for analyzing time-series data, such as physiological signals collected during patient monitoring, to predict health deteriorations or outcomes over time [[24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B24-bioengineering-11-00337)]. For instance, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a sophisticated variant of RNNs, have been extensively utilized in the detection of sleep apnea using polysomnography data [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B25-bioengineering-11-00337)]. Additionally, Transformer models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), offer revolutionary approaches to processing natural language in clinical notes, enabling more accurate extraction of patient information and insights. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [[26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B26-bioengineering-11-00337)] and conditional diffusion models [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B27-bioengineering-11-00337)] have emerged as a powerful tool for generating synthetic medical images for training without privacy concerns, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are unlocking new possibilities in modeling complex biological and health-related networks, from predicting protein interactions to understanding disease pathways.\n\n[Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#bioengineering-11-00337-t001) provides a summary of the various deep learning models discussed, including their applications, strengths, and areas of healthcare they are transforming.\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nOverview of advanced deep learning models in healthcare diagnosis and prognosis.\n\n| Algorithm Type | General Application | Limitations | Comments | Example |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) | Image recognition and analysis in medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRI, CT scans) | Require large labeled datasets and substantial computational resources; can be a \u201cblack box\u201d making interpretability difficult | Highly effective for spatial data; state of the art in medical image analysis | Deeplab v3+, a CNN variant for gastric cancer segmentation [[28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B28-bioengineering-11-00337)].

In healthcare, NLP is used to extract meaningful information from unstructured data sources like clinical notes or the research literature, aiding in both diagnostic processes and the aggregation of knowledge for prognosis estimation [[33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B33-bioengineering-11-00337)]. An example of such a language model is the GatorTron [[34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B34-bioengineering-11-00337)]. It is a large-scale Transformer-based NLP model tailored for the healthcare domain. It utilizes the Transformer architecture, known for its efficiency in handling sequence-to-sequence tasks and its ability to process large datasets, to interpret and analyze electronic health records. With its 8.9 billion parameters, GatorTron is trained on over 90 billion words of clinical text, making it a highly advanced model for extracting and understanding complex medical information from unstructured data sources.\n\nAI algorithms are not just tools for efficient diagnosis and prognosis; they represent a paradigm shift in understanding and managing health and disease. The next sections will provide deeper insights into specific case studies and the role of AI in personalizing medical care, further highlighting AI\u2019s profound impact on clinical decision-making.\n\n### 2.2. Case Studies of AI in Detecting Diseases\n\nThe potential of AI in the early detection and accurate diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other critical conditions has been demonstrated in various case studies. This subsection explores some notable examples, illustrating how AI technology is making strides in the field of disease detection:\n\n1.   Cancer detection: One of the most groundbreaking applications of AI is in the early detection of cancer. A notable case study involves the use of deep learning algorithms in the analysis of mammograms for breast cancer detection. Research has shown that AI can identify patterns in mammographic images that are indicative of cancerous growths, often with greater accuracy than traditional methods. A notable study published in the journal Nature reported the development of an AI model by Google Health [[35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B35-bioengineering-11-00337)]. This model was trained on a large dataset of mammograms and demonstrated the ability to detect breast cancer more accurately than human radiologists. The AI system showed a reduction in both false positives and false negatives, key factors in cancer diagnostics. This progress in AI technology is significant because early detection of breast cancer can dramatically improve prognosis and treatment outcomes.\n\n2.   Diabetes management: AI\u2019s role in managing and detecting diabetes, particularly through machine learning algorithms, is a significant area of improvement in healthcare. These algorithms can analyze patient data to predict the onset and progression of diabetes and its complications, as demonstrated in different studies.\n\nIn one study, several supervised classification algorithms were applied to predict and classify eight diabetes complications, including metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, neuropathy, nephropathy, diabetic foot, hypertension, obesity, and retinopathy [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B36-bioengineering-11-00337)]. The dataset utilized in this study comprises 79 input attributes, including results of medical tests and demographic information collected from 884 patients. The performance of the models was evaluated using the accuracy and F1 score, reaching a maximum of 97.8% and 97.7%, respectively. Among different classifiers, random forest (RF), Adaboost, and XGBoost achieved the best performance. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the potential of machine learning in effectively predicting diabetes complications.\n\nAnother study focused on evaluating the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predicting complications and poor glycemic control in nonadherent type 2 diabetes patients [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B37-bioengineering-11-00337)]. This real-world study used data from 800 type 2 diabetes patients, of which 165 met the inclusion criteria. Different machine learning algorithms were used to develop prediction models, with the predictive performance assessed using the area under the curve. The highest performance scores for predicting various complications such as diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, angiopathy, and eye disease were 90.2%, 85.9%, 88.9%, and 83.2%, showcasing the effectiveness of these models.\n\n3.   Heart disease prediction: The prediction of heart disease using AI represents a significant advancement in cardiovascular healthcare. This application not only aims to predict the occurrence of heart disease but also attempts to determine its severity, a crucial factor in effective treatment and management.\n\nOne innovative study in this area focused on a machine learning-based prediction model that performs both binary and multiple classifications of heart disease [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B38-bioengineering-11-00337)]. The model, known as Fuzzy-GBDT, integrates fuzzy logic with a gradient boosting decision tree to streamline data complexity and improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, to avoid overfitting, the model incorporates a bagging technique, enhancing its capability to classify the severity of heart disease. The evaluation results of this model show excellent accuracy and stability in predicting heart disease, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool in healthcare.\n\nAnother interesting study introduces a cutting-edge healthcare system that employs ensemble deep learning coupled with feature fusion approaches [[39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B39-bioengineering-11-00337)]. This system is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning models that struggle with high-dimensional datasets. It achieves this by integrating sensor data with electronic medical records, creating a more holistic dataset for heart disease prediction. The system uses the information gain technique to streamline this dataset, focusing on the most relevant features and thereby reducing computational complexity. A key aspect of this model is the application of conditional probability for precise feature weighting, enhancing the overall performance of the system. Impressively, this ensemble deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, outperforming existing models and illustrating its efficacy in heart disease prediction.\n\n4.   AI in neurological disorders: The integration of AI, particularly deep learning (DL), in neurology has opened new avenues for the diagnosis and management of neurological disorders. The recent literature reveals significant progress in employing AI for the early detection and more accurate diagnosis of various conditions, including AD.\n\nOne area of notable advancement is the use of deep learning in neuroimaging studies. DL\u2019s ability to process and learn from raw data through complex, nonlinear transformations makes it well suited for identifying the subtle and diffuse alterations characteristic of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Research in this domain has shown that DL can be a powerful tool in the ongoing search for biomarkers of such conditions, offering potential breakthroughs in understanding and diagnosing brain-based disorders [[40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B40-bioengineering-11-00337)].\n\nFurthering this progress, a comprehensive review of deep learning techniques in the prognosis of a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, epilepsy, autism, migraine, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis, has underscored deep learning\u2019s versatility in addressing real-life challenges across various domains, including disease diagnosis [[41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B41-bioengineering-11-00337)]. In the specific case of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, deep learning has shown promise in enhancing diagnosis accuracy. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), researchers have developed frameworks for detecting AD characteristics from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data [[42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047988/#B42-bioengineering-11-00337)]. By considering different stages of dementia and creating high-resolution disease probability maps, these models provide intuitive visualizations of individual AD risk.

Medical imaging\n\nImage recognition and object detection are used in Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) processes for image segmentation, disease detection, and prediction. Deep learning models can effectively interpret imaging data by combining aspects such as tissue size, volume, and shape. These models can flag important areas in images.\n\nFor example,deep learning algorithms are used to detect diabetic retinopathy, early Alzheimer\u2019s, and ultrasound breast nodule detection. Thanks to new advances in deep learning, most pathology and radiology images can be investigated in the future.\n\nDeep learning algorithms simplify complex data analysis, so abnormalities are determined and prioritized more precisely. The insights that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide help medical professionals identify health issues in their patients more accurately and in a timely manner.\n\nFor example, CNNs identified melanoma disease in dermatology images with more than 10% accuracy than experts according to [a study](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/deep-learning-tool-tops-dermatologists-in-melanoma-detection) in 2018.\n\nYou can also read our article on [Computer vision in the healthcare sector](https://research.aimultiple.com/computer-vision-healthcare/) and [companies in AI-powered medical imaging](https://research.aimultiple.com/looking-for-better-medical-imaging-for-early-diagnostic-and-monitoring-contact-the-leading-vendors-here/ \"https://research.aimultiple.com/looking-for-better-medical-imaging-for-early-diagnostic-and-monitoring-contact-the-leading-vendors-here/\").\n\n**Google DeepMind**: Google\u2019s DeepMind has been collaborating with healthcare institutions to create AI models for medical imaging.\n\nIn one notable case, DeepMind developed a model to detect over 50 different eye diseases using retinal scans, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration at earlier stages[2](https://research.aimultiple.com/deep-learning-in-healthcare/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-223252 \"\u201cGoogle DeepMind Uses AI for Eye Disease Detection\u201c.

Mental health chatbots\n\nThe use of AI-based mental health apps (including chatbots) such as Happify, Moodkit, Woebot, and Wysa is increasing. Some of these chatbots can leverage deep learning models for more realistic conversations with patients.\n\nA [study](https://mental.jmir.org/2017/2/e19/ \"study\") by Stanford University shows that an intelligent conversational agent can significantly decrease depression and anxiety symptoms in students, and it is an efficient and engaging way to deliver mental health support.\n\n#### **Real-life example:**\n\nWoebot is an AI-powered mental health chatbot that uses natural language processing and deep learning in healthcare to have conversations with users, providing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to help reduce anxiety and depression symptoms. A study by Stanford University showed that Woebot could significantly reduce symptoms in users by offering timely support and helpful strategies for mental health management[3](https://research.aimultiple.com/deep-learning-in-healthcare/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-223253 \"\u201cWoebot: AI-Powered Mental Health Support\u201c.

The advancement has been initiated and shaped by the applications of data-driven, robust, and efficient machine learning (ML) to deep learning (DL) technologies. ML in the medical sector is developing quickly, causing rapid progress, reshaping medicine, and improving clinician and patient experiences. ML technologies evolved into data-hungry DL approaches, which are more robust and efficient in dealing with medical data. This article reviews some critical data-driven aspects of machine intelligence in the medical field. In this direction, the article illustrated the recent progress of data-driven medical science using ML to DL in two categories: firstly, the recent development of data science in medicine with the use of ML to DL and, secondly, the chabot technologies in healthcare and medicine, particularly on ChatGPT.

Introduction\n---------------\n\nIn the recent era, medicine field is changing very fast. The paradigm shift in medicine was noted in the area of cutting-edge diagnostics of diseases, advanced treatment procedures, targeted [drug therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/pharmacotherapy \"Learn more about drug therapy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and surgery with the recently evolved artificial intelligence (AI) technology like deep learning (DL) technologies. The recent progress of machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in the paradigm shift in medicine. The ML is a form of AI that uses algorithms to predict outcomes precisely. In medicine, these algorithms use medical data to provide new outcomes. Presently ML systems are frequently used in the medical field ([Rajkomar et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0800), [Goecks et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0340), [May, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0655), [Haug and Drazen, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0395)). The first AI-based [cardiac MRI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cardiac-magnetic-resonance-imaging \"Learn more about cardiac MRI from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") software, \u201cCardio AI,\u201d was approved by the FDA (food and drug administration) in 2017 (FDA approved no. K163253), which was developed by Arterys Inc., USA. Subsequently, several AI-based products were approved from time to time ([Benjamens et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0090), [Ebrahimian et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0280)). The approval of AI technologies boosted AI research. Significant AI-related algorithms have been published during the last decade, demonstrating AI in medical science. The information about AI-related algorithms boosted AI-related research in medical science. DL is a subfield of ML that mainly uses algorithms of [neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural-network \"Learn more about neural networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to predict outcomes more accurately. In medicine, DL-based algorithms are more efficient and robust which are mostly used in medical images to solve diagnostics challenges ([Kurokowa et al., 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0565), [Castiglioni et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0150)). In 2016, Gulshan et al. developed a DL-based algorithm for identifying DR (diabetic retinopathy) using the development dataset of 1,28,175 [retinal images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/retina-image \"Learn more about retinal images from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The DL algorithm showed high specificity and sensitivity ([Gulshan et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0370)). In the following year, using DNN (deep neural networks), Esteva et al. developed an algorithm for the classification of skin cancer using a dataset of 1,29,450 clinical images ([Esteva et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0290)). Again, in 2018, Rajpurkar et al. formulated and validated a DL algorithm named \u2018CheXNeXt\u2019 for [chest radiograph](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/thorax-radiography \"Learn more about chest radiograph from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") diagnosis where the researchers used 420 images to classify the clinical abnormalities in chest radiographs ([Rajpurkar et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0815)). Thus, in three consecutive years, these three DL algorithms have created examples in medical diagnostics.\n\nLooking back, it is noted in 1950, Alan Turing was the first to explain the concept of simulating intelligent [behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/behavior-neuroscience \"Learn more about behavior from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and critical thinking using computers. After six years, John McCarthy coined AI. The computer scientist defines AI as the engineering and science of creating intelligent machines ([Chahal and Byrne, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0160), [Kaul et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0525), [Yasnitsky, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b1040)). Several AI developments occurred between the 1970s and 2000s. In adition to that, several computational problems were solved before 2000 by computer scientists. Although, had calculation speed limitations, all these inventions occurred in the computer laboratory. In about 2000, the vanishing gradient problem of DL was appeared. Although in the 1950s, the concept of DL was first developed, its medicinal application was started in 2000 along with several limitations ([Yang and Bang, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b1035), [Kaul et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0525)). However, in 2017, the first US FDA-approved cloud-based DL was developed, Arterys, an application in healthcare. A DL-based medical imaging platform was also developed as Cardio AI, which can quickly analyze cardiac [ejection fraction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ejection-fraction \"Learn more about ejection fraction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") through magnetic resonance, maybe within a second. In 2007, the IBM developed an open-domain question-answering computation system entitled as 'Watson,' usually called 'IBM Watson.' However, another technology was developed, named DeepQA, to give evidence-based medicine. Arterys, CardioAI, IBM Watson, and DeepQA were excellent examples of AI-based [medical technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/medical-technology \"Learn more about medical technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") which were developed between the year 2000 to 2020 ([Kaul et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0525)). After 2020, the progress of AI-based technologies in the medical field was noted very fast.\n\nThe contribution of AI and biosensors in the medical field is significant. In this connection, Qureshi et al. explored recent advancements in AI and biosensors within the medical and life sciences domains. The paper highlights the crucial role of ML in enhancing medical imaging, thereby enabling more accurate diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, the paper delves into the concept of precision medicine, which involves tailoring treatments to individual patients. It emphasizes the contribution of ML in analyzing large datasets to provide personalized care. Integrating biosensors into the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is also discussed, highlighting their real-time monitoring capabilities for physiological and chemical signals. Additionally, the paper addresses technological advancements, such as accelerated AI and edge computing. It outlines the challenges, potential issues, and prospects in applying AI and biosensors in the healthcare industry, emphasizing their transformative impact on medical science and patient care ([Qureshi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0785)). In a separate study, Phatak et al. proposed a comprehensive framework that combines [wearable sensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/wearable-sensor \"Learn more about wearable sensors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), real-time location systems, and AI/ML algorithms for data collection and analysis in sports and healthcare. A vital feature of this framework is the provision of real-time feedback to users, which enhances data-driven decision-making processes ([Pathak et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0775)). Jin et al. delved into the applications of AI in diabetes management, specifically using closed-loop control algorithms, glucose predictions, and calibrations within continuous glucose monitoring systems. The study examines the challenges and opportunities associated with individualized and proactive medicine ([Jin et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0495)). In another study, Lu et al. emphasized AI's pivotal role in analyzing data collected from various biosensors. Their article underscores how AI contributes to the long-term and in-situ monitoring of physiological information, aligning with the broader landscape of IoT technologies in healthcare ([Lu et al., 2023a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0630)). Collectively, these articles reflect the increasing significance of AI-driven biosensors in shaping the future of healthcare. They facilitate data-driven decision-making, personalized medicine, and continuous monitoring, which is crucial in advancing the healthcare industry.\n\nAlthough ML-based algorithms have enriched the different medical fields, at the same time, along with the advancements in ML-related algorithms, there is a considerable advancement in data science and big data analytics in the field of medical science. Researchers are trying to evaluate and find the correlations between real-world medical datasets and big data. Researchers use ML occasionally in clinical, multi-omics, and pharmaceutical R&D (research and development) data in this direction ([Wang and Preininger, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0985), [Ahmed, et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0020), [Alizadehsani et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0035)). Big data in the medical sector can transform data into knowledge. Datasets has been were analyzed for personalized medicine ([Millman et al., 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0670), [Dicuonzo et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0270)).\n\nRecently, ML, and DL models have used to detection of different diseases and assessed through the [randomized clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/randomized-clinical-trial \"Learn more about randomized clinical trials from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (RCTs). Wang et al. created a [colonoscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/colonoscopy \"Learn more about colonoscopy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") computer-aided detection system (CADe) by DL-based platform to detect the [adenoma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/adenoma \"Learn more about adenoma from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The colonoscopy with the CADe system was registered in a [clinical trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-trial \"Learn more about clinical trial from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") on [chictr.org.cn](http://chictr.org.cn/) (Clinical Trial ID: ChiCTR1800017675) ([Wang et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0980)). Hollon et al. developed a diagnosis method for detecting brain tumors using deep CNN (convolutional neural networks). The technology was tested through the multicenter [clinical trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/clinical-trial \"Learn more about clinical trial from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with many patients (n=278) ([Hollon et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0420)). Moreover, the US FDA and other advanced countries have approved several ML or DL-based algorithms and [medical devices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/medical-device \"Learn more about medical devices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for the clinic. Aisu et al. have listed the ML and DL-based [medical devices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/medical-device \"Learn more about medical devices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") approved in Japan. They found 11 ML and DL-based devices received regulatory approval. Among them, five were related to [gastroenterology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/gastroenterology \"Learn more about gastroenterology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and six were related to [radiology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/radiology \"Learn more about radiology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ([Aisu et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0025).\n\nThis article discusses the journey from ML to DL and data-driven patient care. In the review article, we illustrated the ML and DL technologies in medicine in two directions: first, advancement in data science; second, chabot technologies in healthcare and medicine. To illustrate the progress in data science, we discuss medical images data, ML and DL interpretation, data from EMR (electronic medical record) or EHR (electronic health record), big data in personalized medicine, data for [medical research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/medical-research \"Learn more about medical research from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and dataset shift in AI. Chabot technologies with recently developed ChatGPT technology have been discussed. Finally, we illustrated the broad role of ML and DL in medicine and future challenges.\n\n2. The journey from ML to DL and data-driven patient care\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 1943, a [neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural-network \"Learn more about neural network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") model was developed by McCulloch and Pitts , which started the journey of ML ([Wang et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#b0975)). Early neural networks could have been more helpful and insightful. After its origin, ML models continued to evolve. Data-driven ML was built by the research of Hinton. Subsequently, it improved as a DL technique and was popularized in 2012.\n\nHowever, first, the different ML models have been used in the medical field to analyse the medical data ([Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#t0005)). At the same time, the evolved DL models were utilized to analyze the medical data in a more accurate way ([Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590262823000461#t0010)).\n\nTable 1. A list of different ML methods used for the recent data analysis of medicine and healthcare.\n\n| **Sl. No.** | **Significant concept of ML** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | Bayesian learning | This method combined the preceding knowledge information in addition to data, to accomplish ML. |\n| 2. | Ensemble learning | Ensemble learning approaches build many models and use the average of all the models to create predictions. Collective ensemble approaches include the gradient-boosting, random forests, and with the stacking/meta-ensembles. |\n| 3. | Unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning | Unsupervised learning identifies the structure, generally clusters, among the unlabeled data. Whereas, the supervised learning predicts labels or classes on future data, based on past data that holds labels/classes. Semi-supervised learning initially accomplishes unsupervised learning, and humans label structures that found from the unsupervised learning. |\n| 4. | Dimensionality reduction | It reduces the number of features or attributes of a dataset by choosing vital features or merging the features to capture variance in a dataset. Frequently used to increase the machine learning models performance and to support visualization. |\n| 5. | Deep learning | Deep learning is the multi-layer artificial neural networks that can learn the complex non-linear functions. It is too much useful for unstructured data like speech, images, or text. But, usually it does not provide insights in to the aspects of the data which are driving the functions. |\n| 6. | Federated learning | This approaches used for incrementally learning from data distributed in numerous locations. It cannot be united into a single dataset. It is useful when data are positioned in multiple clinical systems, or when the learning occurred from sensitive personal data. |\n| 7. | Regression and classification | These are the supervised learning methods. Regression predicts real-valued outputs such as response to therapy. The classification can predicts discreet categories such as normal vs. diseased. |\n\nTable 2.

In light of that, the promise of improving the diagnostic process is one of AI\u2019s most exciting healthcare applications. Incomplete medical histories and large caseloads can lead to deadly human errors. Immune to those variables, AI can [predict and diagnose disease](https://builtin.com/machine-learning/anomaly-detection-algorithms) at a faster rate than most medical professionals.\n\n### AI in Drug Discovery\n\nThe drug development industry is bogged down by skyrocketing development costs and research that takes thousands of human hours. Putting each drug through clinical trials[costs an estimated average of $1.3 billion](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/clinical-trials-ai-tech-disruption/), and only 10 percent of those drugs are successfully brought to market. Due to breakthroughs in technology, AI is speeding up this process by helping [design drugs](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2023/03/20/how-artificial-intelligence-is-revolutionizing-drug-discovery/), predicting any side effects and identifying ideal candidates for clinical trials.\n\n### AI in Patient Experience\n\nAI can be used to support digital communications, offering schedule reminders, tailored health tips and suggested next steps to patients. The ability of AI to aid in health diagnoses also improves the speed and accuracy of patient visits, leading to faster and more personalized care. And efficiently providing a [seamless patient experience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8812142/) allows hospitals, clinics and physicians to treat more patients on a daily basis.\n\n### AI in Healthcare Data Management\n\n[Highly valuable information](https://builtin.com/big-data/big-data-in-healthcare) can sometimes get lost among the forest of trillions of data points. Additionally, the inability to connect important data points slows the development of new drugs, preventative medicine and proper diagnosis. Because of its ability to handle [massive volumes of data](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/tackling-healthcares-biggest-burdens-with-generative-ai), AI breaks down data silos and connects in minutes information that used to take years to process. This can reduce the time and costs of healthcare administrative processes, contributing to more efficient daily operations and patient experiences.\n\n### AI in Robotic Surgery\n\nHospitals use AI and[robots](https://builtin.com/robotics) to help with everything from [minimally invasive procedures](https://builtin.com/robotics/surgical-medical-healthcare-robotics-companies) to open heart surgery. Surgeons can control a robot\u2019s mechanical arms while seated at a computer console as the robot gives the doctor a three-dimensional, magnified view of the surgical site. The surgeon then leads other team members who work closely with the robot through the entire operation. Robot-assisted surgeries have led to[fewer surgery-related complications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10445506/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20it%20leads,less%20noticeable%20scars%20%5B1%5D.), less pain and a quicker recovery time.\n\nCompanies Using AI in Healthcare\n--------------------------------\n\nThese are some of the companies paving the way for healthcare innovation by applying AI technology.\n\n[](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n[](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n[](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)[![Image 6](https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/company_logo/public/2022-09/EliseAI.jpg)](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n### [EliseAI](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n[View Profile](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n[We are hiring](https://builtin.com/company/eliseai)\n\n**Location:** New York, New York\n\n[EliseAI](https://www.eliseai.com/) specializes in conversational AI solutions.

Introduction\n---------------\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision\u2010making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI\u2010driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. This in\u2010depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI\u2010powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004)]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI\u2010powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)].\n\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. To enable prompt reactions, AI\u2010driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0009), [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0058)]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID\u201019 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement\u2014it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry.

Understanding Al in Healthcare\n---------------------------------\n\nAI is a disruptive force in the healthcare industry that involves novel ideas and changes in conventional methods. This section provides a thorough overview of AI in healthcare, including everything from its basic description to its current acceptance status [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)].\n\n### 3.1. What Is Al in Healthcare?\n\nThe development of computer systems capable of carrying out operations often associated with human intellect is known as AI. Within the healthcare domain, AI manifests through diverse modalities, including ML algorithms, NLP and robotics [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. These technological facets collectively empower machines to scrutinize intricate medical data, discern patterns, and render informed decisions. In effect, AI serves as a transformative augmentation of healthcare professionals\u2019 capabilities [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. AI in healthcare is a paradigm change that affects patient interaction, treatment plans, administrative procedures, and diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare delivery, and raising the standard of care are the main objectives. AI is a flexible toolset rather than a single fix, providing a range of applications that address various facets of the healthcare environment [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\n### 3.2. Types of Al in Healthcare\n\nML algorithms are essential to the healthcare industry because they make it easier to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. Another aspect of AI is NLP, which enables robots to understand and communicate with human language. This makes it easier to perform activities like voice\u2010activated devices or language\u2010based data analysis. Robots, a kind of AI, are used in healthcare through automated procedures and hands\u2010on support during procedures or patient care [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. The hierarchical structure and interdependencies between AI, ML, and DL are depicted in Figure[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-fig-0002). As general AI concepts give way to the next generation of advanced, data\u2010driven learning performances, the correlations show how specificity and complexity increase from AI to DL.\n\n#### Figure 2.\n\n![Image 10: Figure\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 7: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare: A ... - PubMed ---\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763580/\n\nSUMMARY:\nMethods: This review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications.

The study aims to describe AI in healthcare, including important technologies like robotics, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), and to investigate how these technologies are used in patient interaction, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of AI's effects on healthcare while providing stakeholders with a road map for navigating this changing environment.\n\n**Methods:** This review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications. It examines the uses and effects of AI on healthcare by synthesizing recent literature and real-world case studies, such as Google Health and IBM Watson Health, highlighting AI technologies, their useful applications, and the difficulties in putting them into practice, including problems with data security and resource limitations. The review also discusses new developments in AI, and how they can affect society.\n\n**Results:** The findings demonstrate how AI is enhancing the skills of medical professionals, enhancing diagnosis, and opening the door to more individualized treatment plans, as reflected in the steady rise of AI-related healthcare publications from 158 articles (3.54%) in 2014 to 731 articles (16.33%) by 2024. Core applications like remote monitoring and predictive analytics improve operational effectiveness and patient involvement. However, there are major obstacles to the mainstream implementation of AI in healthcare, including issues with data security and budget constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:** Healthcare may be transformed by AI, but its successful use requires ethical and responsible use. To meet the changing demands of the healthcare sector and guarantee the responsible application of AI technologies, the evaluation highlights the necessity of ongoing research, instruction, and multidisciplinary cooperation. In the future, integrating AI responsibly will be essential to optimizing its advantages and reducing related dangers.\n\n**Keywords:** AI ethics; AI technologies; Healthcare Business; data Analytics; digital Health.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

This review provides valuable insights into AI's transformative potential in healthcare while advocating for responsible implementation to ensure [patient safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/patient-safety \"Learn more about patient safety from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and efficacy.\n\n*   [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000525)\n*   [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000562)\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nHealthcare\n\nHealth equality\n\nHealthcare delivery\n\nAI tools\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not a novel concept in the healthcare sector and has already found widespread utilisation. Its integration is increasingly prevalent in healthcare delivery, with the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic precision, treatment efficacy, and overall patient care [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib1). The creation of diagnostic tools is one area in which AI is already utilised in healthcare. AI algorithms can be trained, for instance, to [analyse medical images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/image-analysis-medical-imaging \"Learn more about analyse medical images from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") like X-rays and CT scans for indications of disease or injury [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib2), [[3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib3). By doing so, medical professionals may be able to make more accurate diagnoses, identify problems earlier and therefore use less aggressive or more focused treatments [[3]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib3), [[4]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib4). The creation of personalised medicine is another healthcare area where AI is employed. AI can assist doctors in understanding how patient genetics, environment, and lifestyle affect their health by analysing vast volumes of medical data [[5]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib5), [[6]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib6). Using this information, medical professionals can create personalised treatment programmes that are more effective.\n\nAI can also be applied to boost the effectiveness of healthcare systems. AI algorithms, for instance, can be used to extract patient [medical records](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/medical-record \"Learn more about medical records from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and pinpoint those most likely to develop specific [ailments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/illness \"Learn more about ailments from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")[[7]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib7), [[8]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib8). This can make it easier for [healthcare practitioners](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/healthcare-practitioner \"Learn more about healthcare practitioners from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to focus their resources to ensure patients receive the care they require. However, some challenges must be addressed before AI can fully realise its potential in the healthcare sector. The quality and quantity of training data, for instance, may impact the precision of AI-based diagnostic tools [[9]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib9), [[10]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib10). Applying AI in healthcare also raises ethical questions due to potential biases in algorithms and the possibility of job loss for healthcare personnel [[11]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib11), [[12]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib12), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib13). Concerns also exist related to the acceptability of AI-driven decision-making by healthcare practitioners [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib14).\n\nThus, this review embarks on an exploration of the integration of AI within the healthcare domain, driven by the emergence of novel applications and transformative implications. The rationale for delving into this study stems from AI's progressive integration into healthcare, signifying a paradigm shift with profound implications. The novelty of this review lies in its comprehensive analysis of AI's multifaceted impact on healthcare delivery, encompassing diagnostic precision, treatment personalisation, and healthcare system optimization. Furthermore, the study aims to spotlight AI's role in the creation of personalised medicine. In addition, this review comprehensively examines recent advancements, challenges, and ethical implications surrounding AI's integration into healthcare. By elucidating the multifaceted impact of AI, this research aims to navigate the nuances of its adoption in healthcare, providing insights into its implications and potential future trajectories. Ultimately, the study endeavours to shed light on the transformative potential of AI in revolutionising healthcare delivery.\n\nMethods\n-------\n\nThis review employed a systematic approach to examine the current state of AI applications in healthcare. The search strategy encompassed a thorough exploration of electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, using a combination of relevant search terms. The search terms utilised combinations of keywords such as \"artificial intelligence,\" \"AI,\" \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" \"healthcare,\" \"medical imaging,\" \"predictive analytics,\" \"robotics,\" \"virtual assistants,\" and \"healthcare systems,\" among others.

PRISMA flowchart for selection of included studies.\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### History of AI in healthcare\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare has a long history, going back to the early years of AI research in the 1950s and 1960s [[15]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib15) Early AI efforts concentrated on creating expert systems, which were intended to imitate the capability of human experts to make decisions [[16]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib16). These systems could analyse data and offer recommendations, but their capabilities were constrained by the amount and quality of knowledge that could be stored in them [[17]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib17).\n\nThe availability of large volumes of medical data and developments in computer technology fuelled a fresh interest in AI in healthcare in the 1980s and 1990s [[15]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib15), [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib18) which led to the creation of novel AI techniques more adaptable and potent than expert systems, like neural networks and decision trees. Numerous applications, including decision support systems and diagnostic tools [[8]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib8), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib13), were created using these principles, with the creation of an expert system for diagnosing breast cancer being one of the first significant achievements of AI in healthcare. The IDC-P (Intelligent Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis) system, which included information from mammograms and other medical testing, successfully diagnosed breast cancer [[19]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib19).\n\nDue to the development of improved AI techniques like deep learning and the accessibility of vast amounts of data, the use of AI in healthcare has significantly increased in recent years. Numerous applications, including diagnostic tools, predictive analytics, and personalised medicine [[5]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib5), [[6]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib6), have been created using these principles. The creation of deep-learning algorithms to [analyse medical images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/image-analysis-medical-imaging \"Learn more about analyse medical images from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") represents one of the most remarkable achievements of AI in healthcare [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib1), [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib20).\n\nThese algorithms have been utilised to create high-accuracy diagnostic systems for various diseases, including cancer, heart disease and eye disease. Future healthcare uses of AI are likely to be even more cutting-edge as the field of AI develops [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib13). For example, Neuralink is an emerging AI which functions by integrating a wireless brain chip into the human brain, offering individuals with significant paralysis the capability to manipulate devices such as robotic limbs and smartphones through their thoughts [[67]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib67). However, there are also worries about bias and errors in AI-based systems [[21]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib21) and the need for thorough monitoring and evaluation. Nevertheless, these applications can improve patient outcomes and save costs [[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib22). As revealed by a recent review, integrating AI in healthcare significantly reduces expenses when compared to conventional methods of determining health diagnosis, resulting in a time savings between 3.3 h per day to 15.2 h per day and cost savings ranging from 1,667 USD per day per hospital to 17,881 USD per day per hospital [[68]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib68).\n\nOverall, AI works by simulating human intelligence. It operates through the collection, analysis, and interpretation of vast amounts of data, enabling it to learn from patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention [[69]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib69). By harnessing algorithms and computational processes, AI systems can adapt and improve their performance over time. This self-improvement mechanism allows AI to achieve a level of precision and efficiency in tasks ranging from pattern recognition to predictive analysis. AI technologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilised for medical imaging analysis, while Machine Learning Algorithms power predictive analysis in healthcare. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed for charting purposes, and AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants facilitate communication and support within healthcare settings. Additionally, AI-driven robots, integrating robotics and machine learning, are utilised for various healthcare tasks.\n\n[Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#tbl0005) below outlines specific AI technologies and tools employed within distinct applications in the healthcare system.\n\nTable 1.

By automatically detecting and interpreting images, AI has the potential to increase the precision and effectiveness of medical imaging analysis [[4]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib4), [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib23). Using deep learning algorithms - machine learning that employs neural networks to evaluate massive volumes of data - for image analysis is one of the most promising applications of AI in medical imaging [[24]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib24). These algorithms can be trained to spot patterns in images taken for medical purposes and to detect or predict the presence of disease or damage.\n\nThe creation of deep learning algorithms for the identification of skin cancer represents one of the most significant achievements of AI in medical imaging. Deep learning algorithms have been used to detect skin cancer with an accuracy level equivalent to that of human dermatologists [[25]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib25). Algorithms have also been utilised to create diagnostic tools for breast and lung cancer [[26]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib26). Such algorithms can accurately evaluate CT and MRI images to find tumours and other indications of [malignancy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cancer \"Learn more about malignancy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\").\n\nAI-based algorithms may also increase the effectiveness of analysis of medical imaging. For instance, regions of interest in images can be automatically identified and marked using AI, which can reduce the time and labour needed for manual analysis [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib27). AI-based algorithms have also been used to evaluate [retinal images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/retina-image \"Learn more about retinal images from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to detect eye conditions including glaucoma and [diabetic retinopathy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/diabetic-retinopathy \"Learn more about diabetic retinopathy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with great precision [[28]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib28), [[29]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib29).\n\nHowever, like all technology, there are several difficulties with AI-based medical imaging analysis. One of the greatest constraints is the necessity for a lot of high-quality data to train and validate the algorithms. Concerns exist around the possibility of biases in the algorithms as well as the requirement for continual monitoring and review [[12]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib12), [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib13), [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib14). The reliance on data-driven techniques necessitates high-quality, varied datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance [[70]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib70). However, challenges arise from inconsistent imaging protocols across clinical settings, the vast array of clinical scenarios, and the unique characteristics of patient cohorts in different clinics [[71]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib71). The organisation and standardisation of data from diverse practices present significant hurdles. Moreover, the critical task of data curation, including accurate image labelling, is increasingly difficult due to the rapid growth in the volume of medical images and the expertise required for precise annotation [[71]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib71). These issues are compounded by privacy concerns and regulations that restrict the sharing of patient images across institutions, further complicating the development and application of AI in medical imaging [[70]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib70), [[71]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib71). The potential consequences of biases and limitations in AI applications for medical imaging include compromised diagnostic accuracy, the perpetuation of existing healthcare disparities, and a lack of generalisability across diverse patient populations. Inaccurate or biased AI models can lead to misdiagnoses or overlooked conditions, particularly in underrepresented groups, thereby affecting patient outcomes. Additionally, the difficulties in data sharing due to privacy concerns and the variability in imaging protocols can hinder the development of robust, universally applicable AI tools, potentially slowing the progress towards more effective and personalised healthcare solutions.\n\nPredictive analytics\n--------------------\n\nBy identifying those at risk of disease and delivering tailored interventions, the use of AI for predictive analytics in healthcare offers the potential to improve patient outcomes and save costs [[30]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000616#bib30).

The study aims to describe AI in healthcare, including important technologies like robotics, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), and to investigate how these technologies are used in patient interaction, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of AI's effects on healthcare while providing stakeholders with a road map for navigating this changing environment.\n\n**Methods:** This review analyzes the impact of AI on healthcare using data from the Web of Science (2014-2024), focusing on keywords like AI, ML, and healthcare applications. It examines the uses and effects of AI on healthcare by synthesizing recent literature and real-world case studies, such as Google Health and IBM Watson Health, highlighting AI technologies, their useful applications, and the difficulties in putting them into practice, including problems with data security and resource limitations. The review also discusses new developments in AI, and how they can affect society.\n\n**Results:** The findings demonstrate how AI is enhancing the skills of medical professionals, enhancing diagnosis, and opening the door to more individualized treatment plans, as reflected in the steady rise of AI-related healthcare publications from 158 articles (3.54%) in 2014 to 731 articles (16.33%) by 2024. Core applications like remote monitoring and predictive analytics improve operational effectiveness and patient involvement. However, there are major obstacles to the mainstream implementation of AI in healthcare, including issues with data security and budget constraints.\n\n**Conclusion:** Healthcare may be transformed by AI, but its successful use requires ethical and responsible use. To meet the changing demands of the healthcare sector and guarantee the responsible application of AI technologies, the evaluation highlights the necessity of ongoing research, instruction, and multidisciplinary cooperation. In the future, integrating AI responsibly will be essential to optimizing its advantages and reducing related dangers.\n\n**Keywords:** AI ethics; AI technologies; Healthcare Business; data Analytics; digital Health.\n\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Introduction\n---------------\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision\u2010making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI\u2010driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. This in\u2010depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI\u2010powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004)]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI\u2010powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006)]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0002), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001)]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003)]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)].\n\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0005)]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)]. To enable prompt reactions, AI\u2010driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0009), [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0058)]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID\u201019 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0006), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement\u2014it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0008)]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know\u2010how combine to provide better treatment [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0003), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11702416/#hsr270312-bib-0007)].\n\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's implications for the healthcare sector, emphasizing how it affects operational effectiveness, treatment planning, and diagnosis.

This helps refine diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment plans for each patient\u2019s needs.\n\n### Enhancing Drug Response Prediction\n\nOne key application of AI in personalized medicine is predicting how individuals respond to specific medications. By studying how genes affect drug responses, known as pharmacogenomics, AI can analyze genetic data to find the most effective medications for each patient. This ability reduces adverse drug reactions and improves the quality of care.\n\nAI-driven algorithms can also identify genetic markers related to treatment effectiveness. With this information, clinicians can design customized treatment plans that consider not just the potential effectiveness of a medication but also the likelihood of side effects. This focus on personalization leads to better treatment outcomes and eases the financial burden on healthcare systems by decreasing hospitalization rates and complications from incorrect medications.\n\n### Early Detection of Diseases\n\nAnother important advantage of integrating AI into personalized medicine is its role in detecting diseases early. AI systems can analyze medical imaging data, like MRIs or CT scans, more accurately than human practitioners can alone. Advanced algorithms can spot subtle abnormalities in images, allowing for earlier diagnosis of conditions such as cancer or neurological disorders.\n\nDetecting diseases earlier significantly affects patient outcomes. Early intervention often leads to better prognoses and lower treatment costs. For example, finding cancer in its initial stages can greatly reduce the complexity and costs associated with treatment. Additionally, predictive analytics can assess a patient\u2019s future disease risk by reviewing their medical history and lifestyle factors. This enables healthcare providers to take preventive measures proactively, reducing the need for extensive and costly treatments.\n\nCost-Effective Healthcare Delivery\n----------------------------------\n\nPersonalized medicine improves patient care and brings significant cost savings to the healthcare system. By tailoring treatments through AI, providers can make better use of expensive resources, minimizing unnecessary tests, treatments, and hospitalizations.\n\n### Streamlined Administrative Processes\n\nAI\u2019s impact goes beyond clinical applications; it plays a key role in streamlining administrative processes within healthcare organizations. Tasks like billing, appointment scheduling, and patient data management can be automated with AI-driven software. For example, intelligent decision support systems can improve coding and billing accuracy by cross-referencing claims with clinical data to find discrepancies before submission. This decreases claim rejections and speeds up cash flow for healthcare facilities.\n\nAI also enhances patient satisfaction by optimizing appointment scheduling.

In the post-pandemic world where there is a drive for efficient delivery of healthcare and manage long waiting times for patients to access care, AI has an important role in supporting clinicians and healthcare systems to streamline the care pathways and provide timely and high-quality care for the patients. Despite AI technologies being used in healthcare for some decades, and all the theoretical potential of AI, the uptake in healthcare has been uneven and slower than anticipated and there remain a number of barriers, both overt and covert, which have limited its incorporation. This literature review highlighted barriers in six key areas: ethical,technological, liability and regulatory, workforce, social, and patient safety barriers.Defining and understanding the barriers preventing the acceptance and implementation of AI in the setting of healthcare will enable clinical staff and healthcare leaders to overcome the identified hurdles and incorporate AI technologies for the benefit of patients and clinical staff.\n\n**Keywords:** ai & robotics in healthcare, health care delivery, literature review, barriers to implementation, machine learning (ml), artificial intelligence in healthcare\n\nIntroduction and background\n---------------------------\n\nMedicine has embraced technology over the last five decades and many of the most exciting developments are a consequence of this willingness to incorporate new and novel advances into clinical practice. Of the present areas of development and research, artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered the most attention, captured people\u2019s imaginations, and is unique in that it is the only technology that has the potential to revolutionise every area and speciality.\n\nThe Dartmouth workshop on \u201cSummer Research Project of Artificial Intelligence\u201d in 1956 is widely considered to be the founding event in the field of AI where this terminology was started [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF1)]. The term AI now refers to computer systems and technologies that behave in ways that resemble processes associated with human intelligence [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF2)]. AI in its myriad guises is already embedded in the financial sector, commerce, and science and is increasingly being employed and investigated in the healthcare sector.\n\nAlthough AI encompasses a number of technologies. In this literature review, AI mainly refers to machine learning. Machine learning encompasses the use of data and algorithms to mimic the human decision-making process, with the overall aim of improving its accuracy [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF3)]and is one of the most common forms of AI being used in different areas of healthcare. This is being used to predict the success rates of treatment protocols in specific patient cohorts, to predict the risk of disease acquisition using neural network learning, and to predict outcomes by deep learning where machine learning involves multiple variables and features [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF4)].\n\nUnfortunately, new technologies take time to be embedded in healthcare and despite all the theoretical potential of AI,the uptake in healthcare has been uneven and slower than anticipated and there remain a number of barriers, both overt and covert, which have limited its incorporation. The aim of this review is to identify and examine these barriers to help produce a framework for health systems to implement AI.\n\nReview\n------\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nA review of reports published by healthcare organisations, arm\u2019s length health bodies, and think tanks in the UK was undertaken. This helped to inform the search criteria and ensured that the work produced by the East and West Midlands Clinical Senates would add value, avoid duplication of previous reports, and aid the development of the data extraction tool. Organisations included the UK Government and Parliament, NHS England, NHSX, National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), Health Education England, Care Quality Commission (CQC), Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of General Practitioners, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Academic Health Science Networks - England, Reform, the Public Service Think Tank, and The Health Foundation. Although this list of healthcare organisations is not exhaustive, it has assisted in providing a greater understanding of the emerging AI healthcare landscape.\n\nSearches\n\nSearches of the following databases were performed on 22/12/2021: AMED, BNI, CINAH, EMBASE, EMCARE, HMIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PUBMED. The search had no limitations for year of publication, type of study, or language.\n\nThe following terms were used:\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d OR \u201cdeep learning\u201d OR \u201cmachine learning\u201d\n\nAND\n\n\u201cBarriers\u201d OR \u201cobstacles\u201d OR \u201cdifficulties\u201d\n\nAND\n\n\u201cImplementation\u201d OR \u201capplication\u201d OR \u201cutilisation\u201d\n\nArticles Screened by Title and Abstract\n\nTitles and abstracts were reviewed for potential inclusion in the full-text review according to the following criteria: articles highlighting the possible barriers to the implementation of AI in the healthcare setting and all research methodologies were accepted.\n\nFull-Text Article Assessment\n\nThe selected full texts were included for further analysis and data extraction was done according to the following criteria: articles that have investigated barriers to the implementation of AI in healthcare, where a full-text version has not been published, an abstract only may only be included if there is a significant discussion about barriers to implementation, and an English language version of the study is available.\n\nThis process was done independently by two screeners. Each screener was blinded to the other screener\u2019s decisions and when both screeners had compiled a list of included articles these were compared.Any disagreements between the screening reviewers were resolved by discussion and if necessary, a third reviewer was involved as an impartial mediator.\n\nSecondary Searches\n\nAll the references from the articles in the primary search were reviewed.\n\nData Extraction Tool\n\nAfter review of the healthcare organisation reports, each reviewer independently compiled a list of the barriers to the implementation of AI. These were collated and refined into key broad themes of barriers and further divided into sub-themes to produce the data extraction tool that allowed qualitative assessment of the review articles. This framework was used to analyse the articles found during the literature searches.\n\nData Synthesis Strategy\n\nData are presented in key themes. We performed a narrative synthesis of the evidence for each of the key barrier themes.\n\nResults\n\nSearch Results\n\nA total of 43 articles were included for data extraction following a review of the records identified through database searching. A further 16 articles were included following secondary searches; therefore, there were a total of 59 articles included for data extraction.Figure [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#FIG1) shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.\n\n### Figure 1.

These themes are explored in the discussion.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe key themes identified from the literature are discussed in the order of prevalence within the literature. There was overlap between the themes and the key aspects are explored further.\n\nEthical Barriers\n\nThere are significant ethical concerns that act as barriers to the implementation of AI in healthcare and 39 studies reviewed referred to these ethical barriers. Within the theme, the most prominent were privacy, trust, consent, and conflicts of interest.\n\nTwenty of the studies in this review have highlighted that privacy may be a significant barrier when implementing AI in healthcare. The creation of accurate AI algorithms requires that developers have access to large datasets for training and there is an understandable apprehension that the use of this data may sometimes be at odds with the patient's right to confidentiality [[25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF25)]. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is clear and states that\u201cpatients own and control their own data and must give explicit consent for its use or when it is shared [[64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF64)]\u201d.\n\nIt is essential that patients are fully informed about the fate of their data, and it must be mandatory that they consent for its use when it is to be shared with AI developers. They should understand who can access their data, how it will be stored or used, and how their privacy will be protected [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF13),[29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF29)].\n\nData ownership and consent to store data was highlighted as a concern in 10 studies. He et al. suggested that with wider sharing of data, there is a need to redefine the concepts of patient confidentiality and data privacy [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF27)]. Discussions concerning the development of cybersecurity measures are inevitably going to become increasingly prominent to address emerging issues of improper data sharing [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF27)].\n\nThere is a need for clear governance of AI implementation in healthcare that clarifies the role of all stakeholders in data ownership and use [[65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF65)].Marcu et al. highlighted the importance of having data privacy policies for secure data storage, usage, and sharing to avoid breaches of sensitive confidential data [[37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF37)].\n\nAnother barrier noted in 25 of the studies was concerns about whether AI technology could be \u201ctrusted\u201d. Chen et al. noted that doctors struggled to trust AI for several reasons [[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF18)]. Firstly, health professionals only have limited or no training in evaluating AI software. Most of the evidence relating to the use of AI in healthcare is retrospective and there is a paucity of randomised controlled trials on AI for clinicians to appraise. If these technologies do not have a rigorous evaluation prior to their introduction and use in the real world, this could lead to significant patient harm, irreversible loss of confidence for the medical profession, and inaccurate conclusions being made at the population level [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF6),[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF18)]. There are also concerns that as these technologies are often being developed commercially with the main driver being profit for the parent company, this may affect the level of scrutiny that they undergo prior to their release into the clinical environment [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF27),[66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF66)].\n\nSecondly, the overwhelming majority of algorithms have a lack of interpretability or transparency, and developers cannot (or will not) explain the basis of their decision making, the so-called black box phenomenon [[27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF27)]. Sakamoto et al. suggested that this could lead to issues with both validation and clinical oversight [[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF47)]. It may also affect the doctor-patient relationship as clinicians may be unable to explain decisions made by AI algorithms to their patients [[31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF31)].\n\nAnother potential problem is the utility of AI in complex multisystem diseases. Health professionals may be reluctant to adopt AI into practice if they feel that the system is not sufficiently flexible or sophisticated to cope with complex conditions especially if the decisions cannot easily be reviewed [[36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF36)] and under these circumstances, trust becomes a significant barrier.\n\nConflicts of interest have been highlighted as a barrier to AI implementation in five studies. Brady et al. highlighted this as a current issue for radiologists who may have commercial conflicts of interests by implementing AI; they may be involved in developing or potentially may even receive royalties from. They suggest that this issue should be addressed in an analogous fashion to issues of conflicts of interest while developing medications or medical devices [[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF13)].\n\nThere is no overall consensus on how to deal with these complex ethical dilemmas, particularly in the absence of a strong regulatory framework and the lack of agreement among experts. It is however increasingly being recognised by AI developers that ethical analysis is difficult to incorporate into AI development. A new concept of algorithmic fairness is being incorporated where the AI technologies are focussed on identifying any latent biases and demonstrating an absence of between-group bias [[38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF38)]. However, this approach is not infallible and ethical dilemmas are inevitably going to emerge while implementing AI technologies in real-world healthcare settings in different patient populations. These ethical dilemmas particularly surrounding privacy, trust, transparency, and accountability are major barriers to the implementation of AI in healthcare settings. In the future, they will have to be addressed at the stage of AI development and incorporated into the training of healthcare professionals.\n\nTechnological Barriers\n\nTechnology is a central and prominent theme of barriers to AI. Forty-two articles discussed data barriers including data quality, data access, and data-set size. Twenty-three articles examined how AI\u2019s application can be a barrier with issues relating to interoperability, usability, and integration into current workflows. Validation of data was raised by 18 articles and 15 of those discussed hardware and infrastructure. There were other barrier themes that emerged and are discussed in this section which are also explored elsewhere including explainability and transparency.\n\nData quality, accuracy, and dataset size: Implementing large data sets into AI represents a considerable challenge.It is difficult to acquire and amalgamate large, high-quality data sets that are complete and diverse [[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF12),[18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF18),[47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623210/#REF47)]. AI platforms are limited by the concept of \u201cwhat goe\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 3: Bridging the gaps: Overcoming challenges of implementing AI in healthcare ---\nURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666634025000935\n\nSUMMARY:\nBridging the gaps: Overcoming challenges of implementing AI in healthcare - ScienceDirect Image 4: Journal home page for Med \u00a9 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Notably, AI excels in harnessing vast amounts of data for a variety of purposes, and this article emphasizes the significant potential of AI in achieving \u201cprecision medicine\u201d among those purposes. However, the surge in AI technologies comes with notable challenges, including concerns over patient data privacy, the unpredictability of AI in clinical scenarios, and potential breaches linked with extensive data sharing. The future integration of AI demands a multifaceted approach\u2014from regulating data management and ensuring transparency to reshaping medical education to better incorporate technology understanding. In this context, stakeholder perspectives and prioritizing human-led decisions stand out as pivotal. To truly harness the benefits of AI in medicine, there\u2019s an imperative to navigate these challenges and embrace a holistic, informed approach.\n\n**Background**\n==============\n\nAI in healthcare is advancing rapidly with numerous applications across medical domains. Studies highlight AI\u2019s role in interpreting radiographs, detecting cancers from mammograms to skin lesions, analyzing CT scans, identifying brain tumors, and predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease from PET scans. AI assists in areas like pathology, retinal imaging, arrhythmia detection, hyperkalaemia identification from ECGs, colonoscopy polyp detection, genomics, facial genetic condition identification, and optimizing _in vitro_ fertilization success. Using vast electronic health record (EHR) data, AI extracts critical clinical information, predicts patient risks, improves diagnostic evaluations, anticipates health deteriorations, enhances decision-making, and streamlines clinical workflows. This includes tasks like analyzing doctor-patient interactions and predicting hospital appointment attendance.{1}\n\nClinical care is multifaceted, necessitating a strategic use of AI to elevate care quality and benefit both patients and providers. Operationally, AI in clinical management should address challenges in care logistics, data handling, and algorithm oversight. Broader societal efforts are essential for crafting ethical, regulatory, and payment structures. A holistic, informed approach to AI will foster a dynamic environment for its integration into clinical practice.{2}\n\nMeanwhile, the future of AI in medicine hinges on the ability to protect the privacy and security of health data. With the rising concerns about hacking and data leaks, there\u2019s a pressing demand for algorithms that safeguard a patient\u2019s medical information.{3}\n\n**AI is the Future**\n====================\n\nAI excels in gathering and merging vast and diverse data to individualize medicine and constantly evolve from it. Big data also has a role to play. Complementary technologies such as \u201csmart wearables\u201d have the potential to increase the power of medical AI through the provision of large volumes of diverse health-relevant data, collected directly from the user. The combined impact of these technologies will help us to move closer towards achieving precision medicine, an emerging approach to disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.{4}\n\nIn terms of using AI for pre-screening potential subjects for a clinical trial at site level, numerous studies indicate that EHRs contribute significantly to administrative strain and the rising burnout among both trainee and practicing doctors. AI can make this process of potential participant identification via database search and collecting their medical histories for review faster.\n\nWhile natural language processing (NLP) can aid in streamlining medical record-keeping, ambient clinical intelligence (ACI) provides an interactive digital backdrop for both doctors and patients. This environment can potentially interpret patient-doctor interactions and automatically update EHRs. This can also help site staff to identify a potential participant in real time, if the correct parameters are fed to the AI tools being used. AI can also be used at study start-up stage where AI tools can give real-time information on potential sites that have reliable patient populations and regulatory approval timelines at the country and site levels, among other considerations.\n\nNumerous initiatives aim to harness ACI, marking a pivotal AI application in medicine to address contemporary challenges faced by medical professionals. One major obstacle in embracing AI-driven medical technologies is the concern over medicine becoming impersonal. This is often linked to the expanding administrative tasks placed on doctors. Yet, innovations like ACI and NLP promise to alleviate such administrative pressures, allowing medical professionals to center their attention on patient care.{5}\n\n**Quality and Regulatory Compliance Risk**\n==========================================\n\nMachine learning and deep learning need vast datasets, often larger than those from clinical trials. While specialties like ophthalmology have thrived due to abundant, curated imaging datasets, this also poses risks. While the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d guides healthcare, breaches in patient privacy can result in significant damage, affecting areas like employment or insurance and risking identity theft. Completely anonymizing data is challenging, and there\u2019s always a risk of re-identification. For instance, facial recognition can be applied to CT scans, and machine learning can discern age, gender, and health factors from various images. Over time, even non-image datasets may be able to perform brisk identification by linking with other accumulated patient information. This hinges on handling patient data, intertwining with concerns of patient privacy.{6}\n\nWhen utilizing AI in various stages of clinical research such as the development of protocols, execution of clinical trials, and manuscript creation, copyright issues can inadvertently arise. AI often sources information from a multitude of databases and publications to generate content or make decisions. There\u2019s a risk that the AI might use copyrighted material, unbeknownst to the user, leading to legal complications and questions regarding the originality and authenticity of the research output. Ensuring that AI systems are designed to recognize and avoid the use of copyrighted material is essential to maintain the integrity of the research process.\n\nAI\u2019s data privacy challenges arise from the need for specialized expertise and resource-intensive computing, especially for rare diseases which require data pooling from multiple institutions. This inter-institutional sharing can elevate data breach risks. Partnerships with large pharmaceutical and tech corporations heighten concerns, given the recent emphasis on data monetization, likening it to \u201cdata being the new oil.\u201d The increasing intersection of healthcare businesses and academic data can intensify threats to privacy. Exclusive deals that limit clinical data sharing may contradict the Belmont principle of justice.{7}\n\nOwing to AI\u2019s inherent complexity in terms of transparency, close collaboration with the firms that design and uphold this tech becomes crucial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has shifted its focus to accrediting the entities behind AI development, acknowledging the ever-evolving nature of AI. The European Commission has introduced laws setting standardized AI guidelines, emphasizing privacy and data management similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation. Meanwhile, countries like Canada are still in the process of defining AI-specific regulations.{8}\n\nAlthough AI systems might be trained on extensive datasets, they can come across unfamiliar data and situations in a clinical environment. This unpredictability might reduce their accuracy and reliability, potentially compromising patient safety. Several challenges impede AI\u2019s full acceptance in the medical field. These range from the absence of clinical studies proving its superior reliability compared to conventional methods, to concerns about assigning blame for medical mistakes. Particularly, the application of data protection rules to this context warrants thorough consideration. Properly governing this technology via legal measures is vital to prevent potential loss of human touch.{9}\n\n**Potential Enhancements of AI Tools in Clinical Research**\n===========================================================\n\nGrasping the perspectives of stakeholders is pivotal when crafting policies for AI in clinical settings. It\u2019s imperative for AI developers to prioritize learning, foster dialogue, and team up to address differences in opinions among stakeholders. Tools that aid in visual data interpretation and data aggregation are more welcomed by healthcare professionals compared to ones that directly shape clinical verdicts, or that might jeopardize the clinician-patient bond or the independence of clinicians. Routine digital data tasks, like interpreting radiological or dermatological images, are perceived as more suitable for AI than hands-on or dialogue-based tasks, such as surgical procedures or consultations.\n\nPrivacy concerns are paramount, especially when AI is applied in clinical trials involving sensitive patient data. Different applications of AI, whether in protocol development, trial execution, or manuscript creation, come with varying levels of privacy concerns. For instance, when AI is used in the execution of clinical trials, it may have access to sensitive patient information, raising concerns about data security and patient confidentiality. Ensuring that AI systems adhere to stringent data protection regulations and ethical guidelines is essential to safeguard participant privacy and maintain the trust and integrity of the research process. Clinicians express concerns about potential privacy violations and the challenges in comprehending or directing AI tools. Meanwhile, patients fear the diminished role of clinicians and a lack of inclusive decision-making. A shared sentiment emphasizes the importance of human-led decisions and maintaining compassionate, personalized communication during clinical interactions. Observational studies indicate that patients lean toward human counselors who can understand their individual situations, envisioning AI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for clinical guidance.{10}\n\nFurther, accuracy is very important in clinical research. The reliability of AI in developing protocols, executing clinical trials, and creating manuscripts heavily relies on the quality of the datasets it utilizes. AI systems are only as accurate and reliable as the data they are trained on. Inaccurate, outdated, or biased data can lead to misleading or erroneous outcomes, which can compromise the validity of the research. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that AI systems have access to comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate datasets to enhance the reliability and validity of their contributions to clinical research.\n\nFinally, there might be concerns about the originality and innovation of the AI-generated protocols. In the execution of clinical trials, issues might revolve around the AI system\u2019s decision-making process, its adaptability, and its ability to handle unexpected scenarios. In manuscript creation, concerns might focus on the authenticity and credibility of the AI-generated content. Tailoring strategies and safeguards specific to each application of AI is crucial to address these unique challenges effectively.Top of Form\n\n**Conclusion**\n==============\n\nMedical training needs to integrate modern technology more effectively. Current curriculums offer limited exposure to technologies that healthcare professionals will encounter. For AI systems to be properly integrated into clinical care, specialized training on these technologies, which might independently perform tasks like diagnosis and surgery, is essential. As clinician roles transform, the focus should shift toward handling intricate health situations and to mastering the skills necessary for interpreting and conveying diverse data relevant to specific medical cases. To prepare future doctors for these challenges, a more comprehensive educational approach that encompasses an understanding of technology and its outcomes is vital.\n\n**References**\n==============\n\n1.

The impact of AI in healthcare\n---------------------------------\n\n### 3.1. Foundations\n\nThe concept of AI was first discussed in 1956 [[13]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0130), referring to technology used to mimic human behavior. Since then, the field has made remarkable strides in development. As a subfield of AI, Machine Learning (ML) was conceptualized by Arthur Samuel in 1959 [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0140). He emphasized the importance of systems that automatically learn from experience instead of being programmed. In the 1980s, ML demonstrated great potential in computer foresight and predictive analytics, including clinical practice and machine translation [[15]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0150). Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of ML, has ushered in new breakthroughs in information technology. DL may study underlying features in data from multiple processing layers using neural networks, similar to the human brain [[16]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0160). Since the 2010s, DL has garnered immense attention in many fields, especially in image recognition and speech recognition [[17]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0170).\n\nThe term AI generally refers to the performance of tasks that are commonly associated with intelligent beings by software and/or devices. A specific definition of AI in a recommendation by the OECD Council on Artificial Intelligence states: \u2018An artificial intelligence system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions that affect real or virtual environments.\n\nThe basis of AI technologies is algorithms and they may operate with different levels of autonomy (see [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#tbl0010)) [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0180).\n\nTable 1. Description of AI system autonomy levels.\n\n| Level | Definition | Example | Final decision |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | No presence of AI | Standard care. | Human |\n| 1 | AI suggests decision to human | Clinicians consider AI recommendations but ultimately make the final decision on treatment and therapy. | Human |\n| 2 | AI makes decisions, with permanent human supervision | AI makes clinical decisions on treatment and therapy, with human doctors providing ongoing supervision. | Human |\n| 3 | AI makes decisions, with no continuous human supervision but human backup available | AI autonomously makes clinical decisions regarding treatment and therapy, but it can alert human users in case of uncertainty, minimizing the need for constant supervision. | AI |\n| 4 | AI makes decisions, with no human backup available | AI autonomously govern the clinical decision with no human backup. | AI |\n\nTwo main approaches are actually proposed to develop AI algorithms: the rule-based approach and the ML based approach whose definitions are described in [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#tbl0020)[[19]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0190). These algorithms are translated into computer code that contains instructions for the rapid analysis and transformation of data into conclusions, information, or other results.\n\nTable 2. Description of existing algorithm categories.\n\n| Category | Definition | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rule-based algorithm [[20]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0200) | The system follows a set of rules predefined by experts. | The expert defines the knowledge representation of a phenomenon and integrates this model into the system. |\n| ML-based algorithm [[21]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0210) | The AI system facilitates the incorporation of intricate knowledge representations using statistics and probability theory. | The focus is not on defining a prior knowledge model, but rather on the collection of data and their integration into a training set. This approach allows for the continuous development of knowledge in a specific application domain through the ongoing utilization of data. |\n\nThe huge amounts of data and the ability to analyze data rapidly feed AI to perform increasingly complex tasks [[22]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0220). For this reason, AI in medicine raises the idea that AI replaces doctors and human decision-making. However, applications of AI are still relatively new and AI is not yet routinely used in clinical decision-making. Few of these systems have been evaluated in clinical studies [[23]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0230).\n\nThe use of AI in clinical care is expected to bring about the major changes schematically reported in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#fg0010). There are four main trends recognized by the WHO: i) the evolution of the role of the patient in the clinical care process; ii) the shift from hospital to community-based care; iii) the use of AI to provide clinical care outside the formal healthcare system; iv) the use of AI for resource allocation and prioritization [[24]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0240). Each of these trends has ethical implications, which will be discussed later.\n\n![Image 10: Figure 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405844024023284-gr001.jpg)\n1.

The AI impact on future healthcare system.\n\nPatients already take significant responsibility for their care, including taking medication, improving their diet and nutrition, engaging in physical activity, treating wounds, or administering injections. However, AI could further change the way patients independently manage their medical conditions, particularly in chronic disease conditions. AI could help in self-care, for instance through conversational agents such as \u2018chatbots\u2019, health monitoring tools and risk prediction technologies for prevention programs [[25]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0250). While the move to patient-based care may be seen as empowering and beneficial for some patients, others may find the added responsibility stressful and may limit an individual's access to formal healthcare services.\n\n[Telemedicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/telemedicine \"Learn more about Telemedicine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is part of a broad revolution marking the transition from hospital to home care, and the use of AI technologies is helping to accelerate this journey. The shift to home care has been partly facilitated by the increase in the use of search engines (which rely on algorithms) for medical information, as well as the growth in the number of text or voice chatbots for healthcare [[26]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0260). In addition, AI technologies can play a more active role in managing patients' health outside clinical settings, such as in \u2018just-in-time adaptive interventions\u2019. These rely on sensors to provide patients with specific interventions according to previously collected data [[27]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0270). The growth and use of wearable sensors and devices may improve the effectiveness of \u2018just-in-time adaptive interventions\u2019, but also raise concerns in light of the amount of data these technologies are collecting, how they are being used, and the burden these technologies may shift to patients.\n\nThe increasing use of digital self-management applications and technologies also raises broader questions about whether these technologies should be regulated as clinical applications, thus requiring more regulatory control, or as \u2018wellness applications\u2019, requiring less regulatory control. Many digital self-management technologies are likely to fall in a \u2018grey area\u2019 between these two categories and may present a risk if they are used by patients for their own disease management or clinical care, but remain largely unregulated or could be used without prior medical advice. These concerns are exacerbated by the distribution of such applications by entities that are not part of the formal healthcare system. Indeed, AI applications in healthcare are no longer used exclusively in healthcare (or home care) systems, as AI technologies for health can easily be acquired and used by entities in the non-health system. Emerging is therefore the issue concerning the use of AI to extend \u2018clinical\u2019 care beyond the formal healthcare system.\n\nFinally, with the trend towards self-management, the use of mobile and [wearable devices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/wearable-sensor \"Learn more about wearable devices from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") driven by software capable of acquiring and processing data through sophisticated algorithms has increased [[28]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0280). Self-management systems empower individuals to take an active role in managing their health. They provide the necessary resources and tools for patients to track their health, adhere to treatment plans, and make informed decisions about their well-being. This approach fosters a proactive approach to healthcare, empowering patients to become partners in their [health management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/health-care-management \"Learn more about health management from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Wearable technologies include those placed in the body (artificial limbs, smart implants), on the body (insulin pump patches, electroencephalogram devices), or near the body (activity trackers, smart watches, and smart glasses). Wearable devices will create more opportunities to monitor a person's health and capture more data to predict health risks, often more efficiently and in a more timely manner. Although such monitoring of \u2018healthy\u2019 individuals may generate data to predict or detect health risks or improve a person's treatment when necessary, it raises concerns as it allows for near-constant surveillance and the collection of excessive data that would otherwise have to remain unknown or uncollected. Such data collection also contributes to the growing practice of \u2018bio-surveillance\u2019, a form of surveillance of health and other [biometric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/biometry \"Learn more about biometric from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") data, such as [facial features](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/facies \"Learn more about facial features from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), fingerprints, temperature and pulse [[29]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024023284#br0290). The growth of [biosurveillance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/biosurveillance \"Learn more about biosurveillance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") raises significant ethical and legal concerns, including the use of such data for medical and non-medical purposes for which explicit consent may not have been obtained o\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 8: Ethical and legal considerations in healthcare AI: innovation and ... ---\nURL: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.241873\n\nSUMMARY:\nTable 1 highlights common ethical challenges associated with AI applications in healthcare, providing examples of specific technologies and their implications.

The potential applications of AI in healthcare seem limitless and vary in their nature and scope, ranging from privacy, research, informed consent, patient autonomy, accountability, health equity, fairness, AI-based diagnostic algorithms to care management through automation for specific manual activities to reduce paperwork and human error. The main challenges faced by states in regulating the use of AI in healthcare were identified, especially the legal voids and complexities for adequate regulation and better transparency. A few recommendations were made to protect health data, mitigate risks and regulate more efficiently the use of AI in healthcare through international cooperation and the adoption of harmonized standards under the World Health Organization (WHO) in line with its constitutional mandate to regulate digital and public health. European Union (EU) law can serve as a model and guidance for the WHO for a reform of the International Health Regulations (IHR).\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![Image 3](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41746-024-01221-6/MediaObjects/41746_2024_1221_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Mapping the regulatory landscape for artificial intelligence in health within the European Union](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01221-6?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 27 August 2024\n\n![Image 4](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3Aplaceholder%2Fimages/placeholder-figure-nature.png)\n\n### [What is Spanish regulation on the application of artificial intelligence to medicine like?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02565-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 11 January 2024\n\n![Image 5](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3Aplaceholder%2Fimages/placeholder-figure-nature.png)\n\n### [Patient apprehensions about the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00509-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 21 September 2021\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nRegulating the use of AI in healthcare (Bouderhem [2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR17 \"Bouderhem R (2022) AI Regulation in Healthcare: New Paradigms for A Legally Binding Treaty Under the World Health Organization.

AI systems have the potential (Davenport and Kalakota [2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR36 \"Davenport T, Kalakota R (2019) The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare.

However, AI also poses ethical, legal, and social risks (Jiang et al. [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR81 \"Jiang L, Wu Z, Xu X, et al. (2021) Opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence in the medical field: current application, emerging problems, and problem-solving strategies. J Int Med Res, Available at: \nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/03000605211000157\n\")), such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, patient safety, and environmental impact (Stahl et al. [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR138 \"Stahl BC, Antoniou J, Bhalla N et al. (2023) A systematic review of artificial intelligence impact assessments. Artif Intell Rev 56:12799\u201312831. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-023-10420-8\n\")). The WHO has published two reports on the use of AI systems in healthcare, respectively in 2021 and 2023 (WHO [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR157 \"WHO (2021) Report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence.

World Health Organization. \nhttps://iris.who.int/handle/10665/373421\n\")). The WHO\u2019s reports outline key considerations and principles for the ethical and responsible use of AI systems. AI for health should be indeed designed and used in a way that respects human dignity, fundamental rights and values. AI systems should promote equity, fairness, inclusiveness, and accountability. The WHO\u2019s reports also highlight the challenges, legal and ethical gaps and voids that exist today on AI for health. There is currently a lack of harmonization and coordination between states and key stakeholders with few harmonized standards such as data privacy. It is extremely difficult for regulatory authorities to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation; AI models and generative AI such as ChatGPT are a clear illustration with unknown results and difficulties to predict the impact of such technologies on healthcare systems. The WHO considers that there is a need for capacity building and collaboration among different sectors and regions. The WHO is trying to address these challenges and to develop a global framework for the governance of AI systems for health. Also, the WHO is providing technical assistance and support for the implementation of its principles and recommendations at the national and regional levels. The WHO also encourages the development of innovative and inclusive approaches to the regulation of AI for health, such as co-regulation, self-regulation (Schultz and Seele [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR131 \"Schultz MD, Seele P (2023) Towards AI ethics\u2019 institutionalization: knowledge bridges from business ethics to advance organizational AI ethics. AI Ethics 3:99\u2013111. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-022-00150-y\n\")), and adaptive regulation, that can balance the benefits and risks of AI, and that can foster trust and confidence among the public and the health sector. However, these rules are only a guidance for WHO Members and do not create any legal obligations. Therefore, the WHO should adopt legally binding rules on AI in healthcare as it is the right authority to monitor global health and specifically digital health. The International Health Regulations (IHR) adopted by the 58th World Health Assembly in 2005 through the Resolution of the World Health Assembly (WHA) 58.3 (WHO, IHR [2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR158 \"WHO IHR (2005), International Health Regulations (2005), Third edition, 1 January 2016, Publication, 91 p., Editors: World Health Organization. \nhttps://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580496\n\")) should be amended to reflect the current state of AI systems in healthcare. Also, the importance of regional regulations such as EU regulations should not be minimized (Bourassa Forcier et al.

The objective of the EU Data Act is to harmonize rules relating to a fair access to data and its use by public and private actors. As its predecessor the GDPR, the EU Data Act will help patients to keep control over their health data more efficiently. EU authorities have proposed a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation and promotion of ethical and responsible AI systems in healthcare and other fields. Such AI systems should be based on the principles of human-centricity, trustworthiness and sustainability (Sigfrids et al. [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR135 \"Sigfrids A, Leikas J, Salo-P\u00f6ntinen H, Koskimies E (2023) Human-centricity in AI governance: A systemic approach. Front Artif Intell 6:976887. \nhttps://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2023.976887\n\")). The AI Act ensures that all AI systems are safe, reliable, and respect fundamental human rights such as the right to privacy; another fundamental aspect for EU authorities is to develop innovation and competitiveness. Also, the AI Act aims to enhance cooperation and coordination among EU Member States and stakeholders. The AI Act legal framework also takes into consideration the global nature of AI. It is expected that the AI Act will promote the EU\u2019s leadership and influence in the international field of data protection regulation as it was the case with the GDPR which inspired several regions and countries (Bentotahewa et al. [2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR14 \"Bentotahewa V, Hewage C, Williams J (2022) The Normative Power of the GDPR: A Case Study of Data Protection Laws of South Asian Countries. SN Comput Sci 3:183. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-022-01079-z\n\")). Expectations for the AI Act are very high as observers believe that the new regulation will provide legal certainty and trust for all AI stakeholders. A provisional agreement has been reached on 8 December 2023 (European Parliament [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR56 \"European Parliament (2023) Artificial Intelligence Act: deal on comprehensive rules for trustworthy AI, Press Releases. \nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai\n\")), which suggests that the AI Act could enter into force in 2024. On 24 January 2024, the European Commission adopted a decision establishing the European Artificial Intelligence Office which is intended to become a key body responsible for overseeing \u2018_the advancements in artificial intelligence models, including as regards general-purpose AI models, the interaction with the scientific community, and \\[which\\] should play a key role in investigations and testing, enforcement and have a global vocation_\u2019 (EU Commission [2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR48 \"EU Commission, Decision of 24 January 2024 establishing the European Artificial Intelligence Office, C/2024/390, OJ C, C/2024/1459, 14.02.2024, ELI: \nhttp://data.europa.eu/eli/C/2024/1459/oj\n\")). On 2 February 2024, the AI Act was unanimously approved by the Council of EU Ministers (EU Council [2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR7 \"EU Council, Artificial Intelligence Act (2024) Text of the Provisional Agreement, 2 February 2024, \nhttps://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-5662-2024-INIT/en/pdf\n\")). On 13 February 2024, the AI Act has passed the last legislative stage as it has been approved following discussions on a compromise deal between the European Commission, the Council of EU Ministers and the Joint committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (European Parliament [2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR57 \"European Parliament (2024) Multimedia Center, Recorded Session, \nhttps://multimedia.europarl.europa.eu/en/webstreaming/joint-committee-on-internal-market-and-consumer-protection-and-committee-on-civil-liberties-justice_20240213-0930-COMMITTEE-IMCO-LIBE\n\")). The AI Act has now to be finally approved by the European Parliament in a plenary session scheduled for 10 and 11 April 2024 (Gibney [2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR62 \"Gibney E (2024) What the EU\u2019s tough AI law means for research and ChatGPT. Nature, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00497-8\n\")). EU regulations usually specify a transitional period of two years for their entry into force which means that the AI Act will be fully applicable by 2026. Compliance with the AI Act should start now as the regulation identifies different levels of risks and obligations. Regarding the necessity to adopt harmonized and new legally binding rules for AI in healthcare, it can be argued that states have a general obligation of cooperation under the United Nations (UN) Charter, including in health matters. Therefore, the WHO should be granted coercive powers to ensure compliance with the IHR which need to be amended by states parties to take into consideration the implementation of AI in healthcare.\n\nMethodology\n-----------\n\nThis research focuses on publicly available data up to February 2024. Data collected and articles were first screened according to title and abstract and then the full texts of eligible articles were evaluated. Using the same search query, a gray literature research was performed in English on the Google Scholar search engine, retrieving articles focusing on the use of AI in healthcare with particular attention to regulations, policies and guidelines implemented by the EU or the WHO. I also searched for articles relating to the concrete applications of AI in healthcare to determine the technical, legal and ethical challenges posed by AI. Finally, I searched WHO\u2019s institutional repositories for additional information. I combined the results from the different sources to outline the insufficient current legal framework applicable to the use of AI in healthcare \u2013 mostly soft law rules \u2013 emphasizing the necessity to adopt new legally binding rules under the WHO. AI-generated medical advice such as the GPT chatbot is an illustration of concrete threat to patients\u2019 safety (Haupt and Marks [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR70 \"Haupt CE, Marks M (2023) AI-Generated Medical Advice\u2014GPT and Beyond. JAMA 329(16):1349\u20131350. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.5321\n\")). Therefore, a coordinated and global answer response should be privileged by the international community under the auspices of the WHO. This move will ensure that all WHO Members are legally bound by the same international standards and best practices as there is no universal agreement on the use of AI in healthcare.\n\nConcrete applications of AI in healthcare\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs discussed previously, AI in healthcare encompasses a broad range of opportunities and applications. AI systems and generative AI can improve health outcomes, efficiency, and quality of care. The main purpose of such innovative applications and digital health tools is to enhance patients\u2019 experience and democratize access to healthcare worldwide, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). If used correctly, AI systems will eliminate human bias (Abbey [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR1 \"Abbey O (2023) Artificial Intelligence, Bias, and the Sustainable Development Goals, UN Science Policy Brief, May 2023. \nhttps://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-05/A14%20-%20Abbey%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Bias.pdf\n\")). Some concrete examples of AI in healthcare are mentioned above in a non-exhaustive list (see Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#Tab1)) in an effort to delineate the topic of the study and help to the elaboration of a comprehensive legal framework in the field of AI regulation.\n\n**Table 1 Examples of AI applications in healthcare.**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w/tables/1)\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare will offer better care patient and reduce costs (Sunarti et al. [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR141 \"Sunarti S, Rahman FF, Naufal M, Risky M, Febriyanto K, Masnina R (2021) Artificial intelligence in healthcare: opportunities and risk for future. Gac Sanit 35(Supplement 1):S67\u2013S70. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.12.019\n\")). AI can also reduce errors from human negligence for instance; innovation provided by AI models is expected to improve care management (Klumpp et al. [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR89 \"Klumpp M, Hintze M, Immonen M, R\u00f3denas-Rigla F, Pilati F, Aparicio-Mart\u00ednez F, \u00c7elebi D, Liebig T, Jirstrand M, Urbann O, Hedman M, Lipponen JA, Bicciato S, Radan AP, Valdivieso B, Thronicke W, Gunopulos D, Delgado-Gonzalo R (2021) Artificial Intelligence for Hospital Health Care: Application Cases and Answers to Challenges in European Hospitals. Healthcare 9(8):961. \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9080961\n\")).\n\nRegarding medical imaging analysis, it has been demonstrated that AI systems can help radiologists and other medical professionals interpret images from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and other modalities (Hosny et al. [2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR72 \"Hosny A, Parmar C, Quackenbush J et al. (2018) Artificial intelligence in radiology. Nat Rev Cancer 18:500\u2013510. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41568-018-0016-5\n\")). AI can detect anomalies, measure features, and provide diagnoses based on the images. For example, AI can help diagnose lung cancer from chest X-rays or brain tumors from MRI scans (Chiu et al. [2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR29 \"Chiu H-Y, Chao H-S, Chen Y-M (2022) Application of Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer. Cancers 14(6):1370. \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14061370\n\")).\n\nResearchers and pharmaceutical companies are relying on AI for the development and discovery of new drugs; AI systems can also be used for drug repurposing (Paul et al. [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR114 \"Paul D, Sanap G, Shenoy S, Kalyane D, Kalia K, Tekade RK (2021) Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development. Drug Discov Today 26(1):80\u201393. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2020.10.010\n\")). AI systems can indeed analyze considerable amounts of data (Quazi [2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR122 \"Quazi S (2022) Artificial intelligence and machine learning in precision and genomic medicine. Med Oncol 39(8):120. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-022-01711-1\n\")) from genomic (Chafai et al. [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR22 \"Chafai N, L Bonizzi, S Botti & B Badaoui (2023) Emerging applications of machine learning in genomic medicine and healthcare, Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences, \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/10408363.2023.2259466\n\")), molecular, and clinical sources; such capabilities allow AI systems to generate novel hypotheses and predictions. AI has already been used for drug repurposing or repositioning in precision medicine. Researchers discussed how AI systems could be used for repurposing or repositioning existing drugs which can help design new drug molecules or identify potential treatments for COVID-19 for instance (Zhou et al. [2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR170 \"Zhou Y, Wang F, Tang J, Nussinov R, Cheng F (2020) Artificial intelligence in COVID-19 drug repurposing.

Int J Mol Sci 23(6):3261. \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23063261\n\")).\n\nAI can help predict the risk of chronic kidney disease and its progression in patients (Zhu et al. [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR171 \"Zhu Y, Bi D, Saunders M et al.

By processing large amounts of health data from electronic health records, lab tests, and other sources, AI systems can identify risk factors and provide personalized recommendations. Researchers have been exploring the use of AI in the detection of chronic kidney disease as AI systems can help forecast kidney function decline or prevent acute kidney injury (Toma\u0161ev et al. [2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR146 \"Toma\u0161ev N, Glorot X, Rae JW et al. (2019) A clinically applicable approach to continuous prediction of future acute kidney injury. Nature 572:116\u2013119. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1390-1\n\")).\n\nAnother concrete application of AI is cancer research and treatment (Chen et al. [2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR26 \"Chen Z-H, Lin L, Wu C-F, Li C-F, Xu R-H, Sun Y (2021) Artificial intelligence for assisting cancer diagnosis and treatment in the era of precision medicine. Cancer Commun 41:1100\u20131115. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/cac2.12215\n\")). AI can help researchers but also cancer patients in different areas of cancer care such as diagnosis, prognosis, medical treatment, and follow-up. Following Horizon Europe which is the research and innovation programme of the EU for the period 2021\u20132027, the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA) launched several research projects using AI to improve cancer treatment and patients\u2019 quality of life (HaDEA [2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02894-w#ref-CR66 \"HaDEA (2023) EU health research projects using AI to improve cancer treatment and patients\u2019 quality of life. \nhttps://hadea.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-health-research-projects-using-ai-improve-cancer-treatment-and-patients-quality-life-2023-05-27_en\n\")). Researchers used AI to enhance cancer treatment and predict lung cancer prognosis (Johnson et al.

It concludes with suggestions for improvements to help healthcare professionals better navigate the AI wave.\n\n### Methods\n\nWe analyzed the literature that specifically discusses ethics and law related to the development and implementation of AI in healthcare as well as relevant normative documents that pertain to both ethical and legal issues. After such analysis, we created categories regrouping the most frequently cited and discussed ethical and legal issues. We then proposed a breakdown within such categories that emphasizes the different - yet often interconnecting - ways in which ethics and law are approached for each category of issues. Finally, we identified several key ideas for healthcare professionals and organizations to better integrate ethics and law into their practices.\n\n### Results\n\nWe identified six categories of issues related to AI development and implementation in healthcare: (1) privacy; (2) individual autonomy; (3) bias; (4) responsibility and liability; (5) evaluation and oversight; and (6) work, professions and the job market. While each one raises different questions depending on perspective, we propose three main legal and ethical priorities: education and training of healthcare professionals, offering support and guidance throughout the use of AI systems, and integrating the necessary ethical and legal reflection at the heart of the AI tools themselves.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nBy highlighting the main ethical and legal issues involved in the development and implementation of AI technologies in healthcare, we illustrate their profound effects on professionals as well as their relationship with patients and other organizations in the healthcare sector. We must be able to identify AI technologies in medical practices and distinguish them by their nature so we can better react and respond to them. Healthcare professionals need to work closely with ethicists and lawyers involved in the healthcare system, or the development of reliable and trusted AI will be jeopardized.\n\n[Peer Review reports](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1/peer-review)\n\n## Introduction\n\nRecently, researchers, media, and practitioners have taken a keen interest in developments in artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, since the launch of ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI at the end of 2022, citizens and professionals from all sectors, including healthcare, have been debating the contributions, impacts, and risks of such technologies. This paper outlines the main ethical and legal considerations associated with the development and deployment of AI within healthcare systems.\n\nMedical doctors have used advanced technologies for many years. So why is AI different? *First*, it is far more disruptive. By allowing autonomous, opaque learning\u2014and sometimes even decision-making\u2014in a dynamic environment [[1](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR1 \"Nazar M, Alam MM, Yafi E, Su\u2019ud MM.

Yet, these improvements need to be balanced by the gap that now exists between the development (and marketing) of many AI systems and their concrete, real-life implementation by healthcare and medical service providers such as hospitals and medical doctors. This \u201cAI chasm\u201d [[10](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR10 \"Aristidou A, Jena R, Topol EJ. Bridging the chasm between AI and clinical implementation.

AI legislation has also been called for.\n\nAll these productions are sources of normativity [[33](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR33 \"Boddington P.

In other words, they guide human behavior, providing parameters for what \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be done. However, the disciplines of ethics and law have distinct logics, conceptual frameworks and objectives and respond to different procedures of creation and implementation [[34](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR34 \"Bouquet B. \u00c9thique et travail social [Internet].

First, law is composed of general, impersonal, external and binding rules, accompanied by potential formal sanctions (by courts or police for instance), while ethical norms do not exist in a coherent and organized set of norms \u2013 as in the case within a legal order - and while adherence to ethical principles is voluntary [[35](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR35 \"Robles Carrillo M. Artificial intelligence: From ethics to law. Telecomm Policy. 2020;44(6):101937.\")]. Second, legal rules derive from the state structure, in force at a given time, in a given legal space. The field of ethics, meanwhile, is derived from philosophy, and more recently social sciences, and relates to a reflexive process [[36](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR36 \"Larose G. Droit, d\u00e9ontologie et \u00e9thique clinique. In: \u00c9thique clinique : un guide pour aborder la pratique [Internet]. Montreal: Sainte Justine Hospital; 2015 [cited 2023 Feb 1]. pp. 89\u201396.

Third, legal rules seek to provide a framework for the coexistence of people in society, to protect its members and to guarantee political, economic and social interests at the same time, whereas ethical norms and discussions are more based on moral values [[35](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR35 \"Robles Carrillo M. Artificial intelligence: From ethics to law. Telecomm Policy. 2020;44(6):101937.\")]. In sum, legal rules could be defined as the minimal duty that every person must respect (whether one *can* do something), while ethics encourages reflection on choices and behaviors (whether one *should* do something). In healthcare, ethics first dealt with the manipulation of living organisms through \u201cbioethics\u201d before considering patient relationships through \u201cclinical ethics\u201d and management and governance through \u201corganizational ethics\u201d [[37](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR37 \"Pimont M. L\u2019\u00e9thique : fondements, approches et applications en sant\u00e9 et services sociaux. Equilibre. 2016;11(1):4\u201315.\")]. The latter two aspects are still difficult to grasp today, because they demand a global understanding of organizations that encompasses employees\u2019 issues beyond the relationship of care.\n\nInterestingly, despite the wealth of literature on AI, there is little to show healthcare professionals the main issues with an eye on the conceptual differences between ethics and law. This confusion is important to clarify, considering the different level of opportunities and limitations they bring forward in medical practice. Therefore, in this paper, we highlight how ethics and law approach the issues of AI in health from different perspectives. While law is mostly a local matter, our reflection does not target any one national jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the examples we use to better illustrate our analysis are focused on western countries and regions most active in the AI field (on the governance and technical sides) [[38](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR38 \"Stanford University Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.

To summarize these, we analyzed the literature that specifically discusses the ethical and legal dimensions related to AI development and implementation in healthcare as well as relevant normative documents that pertain to both ethical and legal issues (i.e., AI ethics guides or charters developed by governments, international organizations and industries, as well as legal instruments). After such analysis, we created categories regrouping the most frequently cited and discussed ethical and legal issues. We then proposed a breakdown within such categories that emphasizes the different - yet often interconnecting - ways in which ethics and law are approached for each category of issues. Finally, we identified several key ideas for healthcare professionals and organizations to better integrate ethics and law into their practices.\n\nThe paper is divided into six sections, corresponding to the most important issues associated with AI in healthcare: (1) Privacy; (2) Individual autonomy; (3) Bias; (4) Responsibility and liability; (5) Evaluation and oversight; and (6) Work, Professions, and the Job Market. In conclusion, we advance a few proposals aimed at resolving some of the highlighted issues for healthcare professionals.\n\n## Privacy\n\nIn machine learning or deep learning models, the computational algorithm solves problems by seeking connections, correlations, or patterns within the data on which it is \u201ctrained\u201d [[40](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR40 \"Jean A. Une br\u00e8ve introduction \u00e0 l\u2019intelligence artificielle. Med Sci (Paris). 2020;36(11):1059\u201367.\")]. Since the effectiveness of these models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data[Footnote 4](#Fn4), one of the most common techniques in AI technology development is to collect, structure, and use as much varied data as possible [[41](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR41 \"Cai Q, Luo X, Wang P, Gao C, Zhao P. Hybrid model-driven and data-driven control method based on machine learning algorithm in energy hub and application. Appl Energy. 2022;305:117913.\")]. In the healthcare arena, this data can take many forms - such as measurements of a patient\u2019s clinical vital parameters, biological analysis results, or genetic characteristics [[42](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR42 \"Anom BY. Ethics of Big Data and artificial intelligence in medicine. Ethics Med Public Health. 2020;15:100568.\")] -, and is created and collected from a wide variety of sources, from traditional healthcare system activities to self-tracking of consumers using digital technologies (\u201cquantified self\u201d) [[43](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR43 \"Sharon T, Zandbergen D.

Thus, this type of data is linked to an individual or a group who is directly or indirectly identifiable or targetable. However, health data is much broader than most people realize, and can also cover diet, exercise, and sleep - all collected by private companies outside the health system through connected devices such as smartphones and smart watches. Considering the intimacy and sensitivity of health data and the many actors potentially involved, AI highlights the question of individual privacy.\n\n### The ethics of privacy\n\nFrom an ethical point of view, issues of privacy are rooted in conflicting moral values or duties. The very concept of privacy has been defined in many ways in the ethics literature, with its origine intertwined with its legal protection [[45](/articles/10.1186/s12910-024-01158-1#ref-CR45 \"Walters GJ. Privacy and security: an ethical analysis. SIGCAS Comput Soc. 2001;31(2):8\u201323.\")], so it can hardly be summarized through a single definition.

hot topic into the new year, how are organizations approaching adoption?\n\n[![Image 14: Benjamin

time artificial intelligence has become synonymous with generative AI. When most people discuss AI, they\u2019re usually referring to [large language models](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/07/future-llms-in-healthcare-clinical-use-cases-perfcon) (LLMs) and [related chatbots](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/08/5-questions-about-chatbots-improve-patient-experience). That\u2019s how big of an impact generative AI had across industries \u2014 as well as everyday people around the world \u2014 and healthcare is no exception.\n\nFor many healthcare organizations, AI is still a buzz phrase, but one that is attractive due to its promise to improve clinical and administrative workflows. In 2024, early adopters showcased its possibilities. This year, we expect to see more organizations dipping their toes into the generative AI space. While more healthcare leaders are considering and [preparing for AI implementation](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/solutions/artificial-intelligence-ai.html), they are also pushing vendors to show the actual value their solutions provide.\n\nIn 2025, we expect healthcare organizations to have more risk tolerance for AI initiatives, which will lead to increased adoption. However, they will also be intentional about using solutions that meet a business need and bring ROI in terms of increased efficiency or cost savings.\n\nHere are some of the ways healthcare organizations are likely to approach AI in 2025.\n\n[_**Click the banner below**to prepare for an AI-powered future in healthcare._](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/it-infrastructure-modernization-increases-agility-and-efficiency.html)\n\n[![Image 17: xs_infrasturcturemod_animated_q324_learn_desktop](https://healthtechmagazine.net/sites/healthtechmagazine.net/files/2025-01/xs_infrasturcturemod_animated_q324_learn_desktop.gif)](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/it-infrastructure-modernization-increases-agility-and-efficiency.html)[![Image 18: xs_infrasturcturemod_animated_q324_learn_mobile ](https://healthtechmagazine.net/sites/healthtechmagazine.net/files/2025-01/xs_infrasturcturemod_animated_q324_learn_mobile.gif)](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/it-infrastructure-modernization-increases-agility-and-efficiency.html)\n\nWhich AI Solutions Will Healthcare Organizations Adopt in 2025?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHealthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that\u2019s a better clinician experience, reduced costs, increased administrative efficiencies or improved patient care. Here are some examples.\n\n### Ambient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\n\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with [ambient listening](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/08/ambient-listening-in-healthcare-perfcon), which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\n\nA major reason that [organizations are choosing ambient listening](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/dataanalytics/transformative-benefits-ambient-listening-in-healthcare.html) as a first step into AI is that they\u2019ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\n\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn\u2019t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\n\n### Pushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\n\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with [retrieval-augmented generation](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/digitalworkspace/3-areas-where-rag-implementation-can-be-improved.html). RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization\u2019s more accurate and recent data.\n\nRAG allows the organization\u2019s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of [using generative AI tools](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/11/chime24-setting-record-straight-generative-ai).\n\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\n\nIn the past, organizations didn\u2019t know what questions to ask, but now there\u2019s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the [Coalition for Health AI](https://chai.org/) are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\n\n[_**DIVE DEEPER:**Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization._](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/digitalworkspace/demystifying-artificial-intelligence-adoption-for-your-organization.html)\n\n### **Machine Vision Improves Patient Care**\n\n[Adding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2022/08/what-patient-room-next-and-how-can-healthcare-organizations-achieve-it) enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don\u2019t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\n\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are [added to patient rooms](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/services/patient-room-next-the-evolution-of-care.html), more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\n\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\n------------------------------------\n\nThere\u2019s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to [ensure AI isn\u2019t used inappropriately](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/07/considerations-responsible-use-generative-ai-healthcare). However, it\u2019s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\n\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology\u2019s [HTI-1 Final Rule](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/facas/2024-01-18_HTI-1_Final_Rule_Overview_508.pdf) regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\n\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\n---------------------------------------\n\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to [IT infrastructure](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/11/how-can-healthcare-organizations-prepare-their-cloud-safely-implement-ai). Have an organization\u2019s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\n\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable [AI solutions require good data governance](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/dataanalytics/data-governance-strategies-for-ai-success.html). The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization\u2019s environment. If the data isn\u2019t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\n\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It\u2019s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\n\n[_**CONSIDER:**When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?_](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/cloud/when-the-cloud-is-right-for-organizations-deploying-artificial-intelligence.html)\n\nIT leaders also need to [consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2024/10/ai-in-healthcare-how-its-used-future-perfcon) while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it\u2019s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\n\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won\u2019t. Tools that don\u2019t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it\u2019s always done instead.\n\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. [CDW](https://www.cdw.com/) offers [data workshops](https://dvs.cdw.com/icx-workshop) to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer [strategy engagements for modern data platforms](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/solutions/analytics/modern-data-platform.html) and deploying generative AI.\n\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn\u2019t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\n\n_This article is part of_ HealthTech _\u2019s_[_MonITor blog

Understanding these risks and developing effective mitigation strategies is crucial for maximizing AI's positive impact.\n\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what we don't know. AI in this stage of its development is a fairly new technology, so its long-term implications are a terra incognito for the entire industry. Proper risk management and adherence to the fundamental principles of [AI TRiSM](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-it-takes-to-make-ai-safe-and-effective) (AI Trust, Risk, and Security Management) will help businesses avoid major potential threats on this path.\n\nWhile healthcare is one of the most regulated industries the world over, this is good news in the case of the Artificial Intelligence adoption. HIPAA, GDPR, the HITECH Act already have quite a few of the safeguards needed to keep patient data and other sensitive information secure.\n\nIn this series of articles on AI in healthcare, we explore key factors that make Artificial Intelligence technology so critical for the health and wellbeing of the species. I this piece, let us deep-dive into the potential negative outcomes and how to overcome them.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662f5a172bc77f3d81c617b2/66ffdc6f64ca6118f13bf292_66ffdc3885fb5c5c1a756a4a_AI%2520in%2520healthcare%2520concerns%2520and%2520risks.png)\n\n## Data privacy and security risks in healthcare\n\nData is a valuable asset, this is why [EMR](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/ehr-vs-emr/) (Electronic Medical Records) and EHR (Electronic Health Records) storage and processing have so many regulatory guidelines. Bigger corporations will have their own data to train models with, but when it comes to smaller companies and startups, having access to data (even anonymized) is critical. \u00c2\n\nThe industry is yet to learn how to regulate, store, and exchange the data with community clouds being one of the pieces of the puzzle.\n\n### Risks:\n\n#### Unauthorized access and data breaches\n\nThe extensive use of sensitive patient data increases the risk of cyberattacks and unauthorized access, potentially leading to identity theft and loss of patient confidentiality.\n\n#### Inadequate data protection measures\n\nInsufficient security protocols can result in accidental data leaks and misuse of personal health information.\n\n### Mitigation strategies:\n\n#### Robust encryption and security protocols\n\nImplementing advanced encryption methods and multi-factor authentication to protect data integrity and confidentiality is already an industry standard that is gaining even more significance now.\n\n#### Compliance with regulatory standards in healthcare (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA)\n\nCompanies need to adhere strictly to regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring that all AI systems meet legal requirements for data protection and patient privacy. \u00c2\n\n#### Regular security audits and assessments\n\nWhile major pharmaceutical companies have rigid internal and external security audits, this continuous audit and monitoring mindset is applicable to smaller players in HealthTech as well. Conducting ongoing evaluations of security systems helps to identify and address vulnerabilities promptly.\n\n#### Data anonymization and de-identification\n\nDue to the highly sensitive nature of health records, this [PII data](https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii) needs to be anonymized as early on the chain as possible, leaving the scientists and developers with pure statistical input. \u00c2\n\nUtilizing techniques to remove personally identifiable information from datasets used in AI training and analysis is expected to be widely used across the board in HealthTech.\n\n## Algorithmic bias and fairness issues\n\nCountries with developed economies tend to have better healthcare systems with plenty of structured and unstructured health records to train models upon. The level of healthcare across different continents can be demonstrated with the life expectancy [statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1302736/global-life-expectancy-by-region-country-historical/) as one of the factors: in LatAm countries people live 75 years on average, in Western Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 81, in Asia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 73 years, and in Africa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only 66 years.\n\nStates with poor health infrastructure, outdated medical equipment, and poorly digitized public healthcare ecosystems will have little info to share with AI models.\n\nSimilarly, some age groups may take their health issues more or less seriously, giving rise to another form of bias when it comes to available data. \u00c2\n\nEven culturally some nations are less prone to visit doctors as their mentality may be more stoic in essence, or more natural-remedy-inclined.\n\n### Risks:\n\n#### Disparities in healthcare outcomes\n\nBiased AI models can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare by providing less accurate or effective services to certain populations.\n\n#### Reduced trust in AI systems\n\nAwareness of biases can lead to skepticism and reluctance among both patients and healthcare providers to adopt AI technologies.\n\n### Mitigation strategies:\n\n#### Diverse and representative datasets \u00c2\n\nCompanies need to ensure that training data encompasses a wide range of demographic groups and clinical scenarios to enhance the generalizability and fairness of AI models.\n\n#### Bias detection and correction mechanisms\n\nResearch institutions and data scientists working in the healthcare sector should learn to implement methods to identify, quantify, and rectify biases within AI algorithms throughout the development and deployment processes.\n\n#### Transparent model development\n\nIn the ideal scenario, the HealthTech industry will learn to maintain transparency in how AI models are developed and make information about data sources and methodologies available to stakeholders.\n\n#### Inclusive stakeholder engagement \u00c2\n\nAnother way to prevent bias is to involve diverse groups, including clinicians, patients, and ethicists, in the design and evaluation of AI systems, - to ensure that multiple perspectives are considered.\n\n## Over-reliance on AI and reduced human oversight\n\nAs humanity witnesses more instances of successful AI implementation, companies may grow to rely on Artificial Intelligence more, creating potential caveats for errors and oversights to slip into the process and outcomes.\n\nIn the medical field, human supervision is critical due to the cost of the mistake and the fact, that diagnostics and treatment are so complex and have many unique variables.\n\n### Risks:\n\n#### Diagnostic and treatment errors \u00c2\n\nExcessive dependence on AI recommendations without adequate human judgment can lead to errors, especially in complex or atypical cases.\n\n#### Erosion of clinical skills\n\nReliance on automated systems may diminish healthcare professionals' expertise and decision-making abilities over time.\n\n### Mitigation strategies:\n\n#### Maintaining human-in-the-loop systems\n\nTo mitigate the over-reliance on AI in Healthcare companies will need to design AI applications to support rather than replace human clinicians, ensuring that final decisions involve human oversight and expertise.\n\n#### Comprehensive training and education \u00c2\n\nTraining for healthcare professionals on effectively integrating AI tools into their practice is going to be a pivotal component to maintain critical thinking and clinical judgment.\n\n#### Establishing clear accountability frameworks\n\nCAIOs of medical institutions need to focus on defining roles and responsibilities clearly, ensuring that accountability for patient outcomes remains with qualified healthcare providers.\n\n## Regulatory and legal challenges related to the use of AI\u00c2\u00a0in healthcare\n\nGovernmental and commercial institutions alike have their stance on AI in its early formative stages. Humanity will see more regulations and governance in terms of Artificial Intelligence, specifically in such a high-litigation industry as healthcare.\n\nOne such Pan-American initiative is a [Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/).\n\nBelow we set out the most eminent risks in legal perspective and ways to minimize negative effects.\n\n### Risks:\n\n#### Lack of standardization\n\nInconsistent regulations and standards across regions can create confusion and hinder the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare.\n\n#### Liability concerns \u00c2\n\nDetermining legal responsibility for errors made by AI systems can be complex, potentially leading to litigation and financial risks.\n\n### Mitigation strategies:\n\n#### Developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks\n\nOne of the key short-term missions of the industry is to develop a fair playing field for all institutions. Authorities and businesses need to collaborate with policymakers, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies to establish clear and consistent guidelines for AI in healthcare.\n\n#### Ongoing policy adaptation\n\nIt is critical that policymakers update regulations continuously to keep pace with rapid technological advancements and emerging ethical considerations. \u00c2\n\n#### Insurance and liability coverage\n\nAnother focal point is with the insurance industry, which will need to develop appropriate insurance models and legal agreements that address liability issues related to AI usage in clinical settings. \u00c2\n\nJust like any other major pharmaceutical company, Astra Zeneca has several digital optimization initiatives in scientific and administrative departments. For example, they use Gen AI to improve the efficiency of their regulatory submissions. \u00c2\n\n## Technical limitations and reliability issues\n\nAs a maturing technology, AI-powered systems have many technical inconsistencies and errors to overcome.\n\n### Risks: \u00c2\n\n#### System failures and errors\n\nTechnical glitches, inaccuracies, or system downtimes can disrupt healthcare services and compromise patient safety.\n\n#### Interoperability challenges\n\nDifficulties in integrating AI systems with existing healthcare infrastructure can limit their effectiveness and utility.\n\n### Mitigation strategies:\n\n#### Rigorous testing and validation\n\nThe first way to lower any technical risks is by conducting extensive testing under diverse conditions to ensure the reliability and accuracy of AI systems before deployment.\n\n#### Robust infrastructure and support\n\nIt is vital to invest in high-quality technical infrastructure and provide ongoing maintenance and support to prevent and address technical issues promptly.\n\n#### Standardized protocols for integration\n\nAs it stands right now, all major CSP like AWS, Azure by Microsoft, GCP are working to adapt their products to the AI era. Undeniably, we will see more actions to develop and adopt standards that facilitate seamless interoperability between AI applications and existing healthcare systems.\n\n## Economic and workforce implications\n\nAs AI and ML algorithms decrease the time for processing mundane administrative tasks significantly, wide adoption of this technology will inevitably lead to shifts in the workforce.\n\n### Risks:\n\n#### Job displacement \u00c2\n\nAutomation of certain tasks may lead to job losses or shifts in workforce requirements within the healthcare sector.\n\n#### Economic disparities\n\nHigh costs associated with implementing advanced AI technologies may widen the gap between well-funded and under-resourced healthcare facilities.\n\n### Mitigation strategies: \u00c2\n\n#### Reskilling and upskilling programs for AI engineers in healthcare\n\nCompanies will provide training opportunities for healthcare workers to adapt to new roles and responsibilities that emerge alongside AI integration.\n\n#### Equitable access initiatives\n\nGlobal, federal, and state healthcare institutions should aim to develop funding models and policies that support the adoption of AI technologies across diverse healthcare settings, including those in low-resource areas.\n\n#### Collaborative human-AI models\n\nBoth governmental and commercial bodies in the healthcare industry can reduce the risks of negative AI impact on the workforce by emphasizing models where AI augments human capabilities, leading to enhanced job satisfaction and productivity rather than replacement.\n\nThe CAIO of General Electric's HealthCare, for example, recognizes the value of AI as the facilitator of the operational and administrative processes:\n\n## Maximizing AI's potential in healthcare through risk mitigation\n\nWhile the potential of AI in healthcare is vast, from improving diagnostic accuracy to optimizing treatment plans, its implementation must be approached with care. Ensuring data privacy, reducing algorithmic bias, and maintaining transparency are critical steps in minimizing risks associated with AI. \u00c2\n\nA meticulous and well-regulated approach, combined with ongoing collaboration between technologists, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, will be essential to harness AI's full potential while safeguarding patient welfare and maintaining trust in the healthcare system.\n\n###### Content\n\n## You may also like\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662f5a172bc77f3d81c617b2/66fd13632a0d340ec5d3d6e3_logistics%20and%20transportation-2.jpg)\n\n### 20 AI applications in logistics with powerful transformative impact potential\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662f5a172bc77f3d81c617b2/66fcf155282f867cbb2d1c6f_ai%20in%20healthcare%20benefits.jpg)\n\n### Benefits of AI in healthcare: transforming diagnostics, treatment, and operational efficiency\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/662f5a172bc77f3d81c617b2/66fcf893fb11cddcd243451c_AI%20in%20logistics.jpg)\n\n### Harnessing AI in logistics: Technologies, strategic benefits & concerns for modern supply chains\n\n# Contact CIGen\n\nConnect with CIGen technical experts.

management considerations for healthcare\n====================================================================================\n\nBy [Joan M. Porcaro](https://www.wtwco.com/en-us/insights/all-insights#sort=%40fdate13762%20descending&f:@authors=[Joan%20M.%20Porcaro]) | October 11, 2023\n\nThe rapid development of AI applications is transforming patient-facing services, including diagnostics and predictive analytics for enhancing prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nadd close\n\nUnlock More\n\nA Leader\u2019s Guide to Evaluating New Technology\n\n[This guide](https://www.wtwco.com/-/media/wtw/insights/2023/10/healthcare--ai-and-technology-checklist.pdf?modified=20231005122920) serves as a tool for leadership to utilize when evaluating product and device acquisition.\n\nFollowing the news, it's evident that healthcare professionals are keenly interested and engaged in discussions surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The rapid development of AI applications is transforming patient-facing services, including diagnostics and predictive analytics for enhancing prevention and treatment strategies. As the surge of new applications continues, risk management professionals are increasingly taking notice.\n\n#### Background: Navigating the evolution of AI\n\nTaking a moment to reflect, AI is not a recent invention. Mathematician Alan Turing published the first paper on AI benefits in [1950](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/06au/projects/history-ai.pdf). While the concept isn't new, the intrigue lies in the evolving applications for patients and providers. The potential applications of AI in various facets of life have grown exponentially.\n\nKeeping up with the definitions for computer and robotic applications has become somewhat frenetic as well. For the purposes of this article, let\u2019s review the language of AI.\n\n#### What is artificial intelligence (AI)?\n\nWhile everyone\u2019s definition of AI is different depending on who you ask, generally speaking, AI is a broad branch of computer science concerned with creating systems, applications, and machines capable of performing tasks too complex for humans. It achieves this by processing and analyzing data, enabling it to understand and learn from past data points through specially designed [AI algorithms](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/algorithms).\n\nDespite the hype and fear surrounding the term \"artificial intelligence,\" it is already employed globally for tasks ranging from mundane to incredible. Some [common examples](https://www.iotforall.com/8-helpful-everyday-examples-of-artificial-intelligence) of AI include smart assistants like Alexa and Siri, social media monitoring, face recognition, smartphones, search engines like Google, and much more.\n\n#### What are predictive analytics?\n\n[Predictive analytics](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/what-is-predictive-analytics), a common tool in data science, interprets historical data to make informed predictions about the future. It employs techniques such as data mining, modeling, machine learning and statistics, aiding in identifying upcoming risks and opportunities for organizations. Examples of predictive analytics in action includes weather forecasting, Amazon\u2019s recommendations for purchase and similar items, modeling of flu trends and insurance risk assessments.\n\nWhile AI and predictive analytics overlap, the most significant difference lies in autonomy. AI can be autonomous and learn independently, whereas predictive analytics often requires human interaction to help query data, identify trends, and test assumptions.\n\n#### Machine learning (ML)\n\nAI and ML [overlap considerably](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/predictive-analytics-vs-machine-learning), with ML being a subset of AI. However, key differences exist, beyond just the fact that AI is a broader term than ML. AI aims to create computer systems imitating the human brain, focusing on broad and complex problems. In contrast, ML is more task-focused, training machines to perform specific tasks and learn in the process. AI tends to focus on solving broad and complex problems, whereas ML focuses on streamlining a certain task to maximize performance.\n\n[Unlike predictive analytics](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/predictive-analytics-vs-machine-learning), ML can be autonomous and has broader applications beyond predicting data, including error detection, pattern recognition, and more. Predictive analytics can use ML to achieve its goal of predicting data, but that\u2019s not the only technique it uses.\n\n#### Benefits: What can AI do?\n\nPredictive analytics is a core function of AI, rapidly analyzing large volumes of data and classifying data points. Machines can learn from experience and can be trained to accomplish specific tasks. Examples of AI applications include predictive analytics, clinical pathway decision-making, wearable tech, and off-site or home-based patient monitoring. AI can enhance efficiency, support workforce shortages, provide accurate work product and reduce training costs.\n\n#### Addressing workforce shortages with workflow automation and AI\n\nRadiology departments [increase productivity with healthcare technology](https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/features/2022/20221124-10-real-world-examples-of-ai-in-healthcare.html) that leverages AI to enable faster scan times with higher resolution in imaging modalities like MR, even with patients who are in pain or struggle to hold their breath during an exam. As a result, radiology departments can scan more patients in a day while supporting diagnostic confidence and improving the patient experience at the same time.\n\n#### Risks: A cautionary tale\n\nThe [use of AI](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/emea/who-warns-about-risks-ai-healthcare) in clinical diagnostics and monitoring carries both risks and benefits. Predictive analytics can assist in identifying potential health issues, yet unknown risks and awareness of assumptions can emerge with the adoption of new technology over time. Many remain optimistic that large language \u201cgenerative artificial intelligence\u201d models will improve healthcare. However, this isn\u2019t the first time that using algorithms to make recommendations has gone awry.\n\n#### Good news\n\nAI can manage repetitive tasks, increase efficiency while reducing error rates for work processes and potentially reduce caregiver burnout by handling administrative tasks that burden providers in current healthcare settings. The American Medical Association (AMA) [reports that 20 hours or more per week](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/sustainability/do-you-spend-more-time-administrative-tasks-your-peers) are spent on administrative tasks, and AI could alleviate this burden.\n\nSacramento, Calif.-based [Sutter Health](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/innovation/how-far-is-too-far-for-ai-in-healthcare.html), for instance, uses augmented intelligence to redirect 20% of patient portal messages away from physicians to a more appropriate care-team member and give personalized, anticipatory advice to expectant mothers, leading to a 15% drop in in-basket messages there.\n\nFrom the staff perspective, digital and AI solutions may offer a way to alleviate some of the load on the care team while also providing training tools that are cutting edge.\n\n#### Not ready for prime time\n\nIn a demonstration conducted by UNC Health, another AI format, ChatGPT was used to offer [medical advice](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/innovation/how-far-is-too-far-for-ai-in-healthcare.html). ChatGPT was given information that included a patient\u2019s health history and then asked how the patient should be treated. While the results were spot on to how the human doctor proposed to treat the patient, the use of ChatGPT for medical diagnosis has created some controversy and concerns linger regarding inaccuracies and \u201c[made-up](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/innovation/that-is-exactly-how-we-treated-the-patient-chatgpt-updates-medical-expertise-surprises-physicians.html)\u201d information in similar scenarios.\n\nThere are limitations and risks to these delivery processes and it\u2019s imperative that the healthcare professional understand what AI can, and cannot, do. Due diligence is needed, including the following areas:\n\n*   **Biased decision making**: Although there are [many opportunities](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/emea/who-warns-about-risks-ai-healthcare) for AI, a report from the World Health Organization points out associated challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data, biases encoded in algorithms, as well as risks to patient safety, cybersecurity and the environment.\n*   **Socioeconomic inequality**: Algorithms may create an opportunity for abuses (think deepfakes), such as sparking concerns for job loss because of automation. \n*   **Privacy violations**: [Privacy](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence) may not be assured for virtual care or AI, and personal health information may be at risk of breach.\n*   **Available historical data**: AI requires [massive data sets](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/arguing-the-pros-and-cons-of-artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare) in order to \u201clearn,\u201d thus requiring volumes of patient health information for the machine learning to take place. With this level of \u201cmachine\u201d training, data output validation takes place. AI and machine learning foster the [creation](https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/artificial-intelligence-and-medical-liability-system-reforms/) of algorithms. With continued advancement of this technology, some groundbreaking applications offer a new way to monitor risks \u2014 the so-called \u2018[black box algorithm](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/The-Artificial-Intelligence-Black-Box-and-the-Failure-of-Intent-and-Causation-Yavar-Bathaee.pdf).\u2019 These algorithms are constantly updating and learning based on data inputs \u2014 but the exact identity and weighting of variables cannot be determined as they constantly evolve.\n*   **Learning curve**: Ensure that staff understand the limitations of AI.\n*   **Human factors**: However, at issue relative to risks and benefits is the possibility that AI may not be able to interpret all human nuances, which could result in biases, lapses and unintended consequences in care. While AI can certainly enhance the capabilities of healthcare providers, it should never replace them entirely.\n*   **Ethical issues and dilemmas**: Ethical concerns are justified when [false](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence) information is pushed out. Another issue to consider: Do people want early warning of insipient disease?\n\n#### Regulations\n\nCurrently, AI regulations are absent in the United States, but changes are anticipated. The White House's \"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights\" outlines principles guiding the design and implementation of automated systems, emphasizing safety, non-discrimination\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 8: Risks and remedies for artificial intelligence in health care - Brookings ---\nURL: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/risks-and-remedies-for-artificial-intelligence-in-health-care/\n\nSUMMARY:\nIntroduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly entering health care and serving major roles, from automating drudgery and routine tasks in medical practice to managing patients and medical resources. As developers create AI systems to take on these tasks, several risks and challenges emerge, including the risk of injuries to patients from AI system errors, the risk to patient privacy of data acquisition and AI inference, and more. Potential solutions are complex but involve investment in infrastructure for high-quality, representative data; collaborative oversight by both the Food and Drug Administration and other health-care actors; and changes to medical education that will prepare providers for shifting roles in an evolving system. The most obvious risk is that AI systems will sometimes be wrong, and that patient injury or other health-care problems may result.\n\nFULL CONTENT:\nRisks and remedies for artificial intelligence in

As developers create AI systems to take on these tasks, several risks and challenges emerge, including the risk of injuries to patients from AI system errors, the risk to patient privacy of data acquisition and AI inference, and more. Potential solutions are complex but involve investment in infrastructure for high-quality, representative data; collaborative oversight by both the Food and Drug Administration and other health-care actors; and changes to medical education that will prepare providers for shifting roles in an evolving system.\n\nPotential benefits\n------------------\n\nAlthough the field is quite young, AI has the potential to play at least four major roles in the health-care system:1**Pushing boundarie\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 9: How to mitigate the risks of deployment of artificial intelligence in ... ---\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11265878/\n\nSUMMARY:\nAs in many areas of education, AI offers important opportunities in medical education. For example, generative AI applications such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini provide personalized training and adaptive feedback to medical students [22,42]. The rapid integration of AI systems into health care comes with both benefits and risks.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--- SOURCE 10: PDF ---\nURL: https://www.ihi.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Health-Care-Implications-for-Safety.pdf\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe excitement surrounding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is palpable, especially for generative AI (genAI) tools such as ChatGPT. Yet, the specific potential benefits of such tools in health care, as well as the risks and unintended challenges potentially associated with their implementation, are not well understood.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
